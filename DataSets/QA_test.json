dialects of the northwestern areas between Isfahan and Azerbaijan, and \"P\u00e2rsi\" (\"Persian\" proper) to describe the Dialects of Fars.", "They also noted that the unofficial language of the royalty itself was yet another dialect, \"Khuzi\", associated with the western province of Khuzestan.", "The Islamic conquest also brought with it the adoption of Arabic script for writing Persian and much later, Kurdish, Pashto and Balochi.", "All three were adapted to the writing by the addition of a few letters.", "This development probably occurred some time during the second half of the 8th century, when the old middle Persian script began dwindling in usage.", "The Arabic script remains in use in contemporary modern Persian.", "Tajik script was first Latinised in the 1920s under the

fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after Texas, North Dakota, and California.", "Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope is still the second highest-yielding oil field in the United States, typically producing about 400,000 barrels per day (64,000 m3/d), although by early 2014 North Dakota's Bakken Formation was producing over 900,000 barrels per day (140,000 m3/d).", "Prudhoe Bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in North America, but was much smaller than Canada's enormous Athabasca oil sands field, which by 2014 was producing about 1,500,000 barrels per day (240,000 m3/d) of unconventional oil, and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate.", "The Trans-Alaska Pipeline can transport and pump up to 2.1 million barrels (330,000 m3) of crude oil per day, more than any other crude oil pipeline in the United States.", "Additionally, substantial coal deposits are found in Alaska's bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal basins.", "The United States Geological Survey estimates that there are 85.4 trillion cubic feet (2,420 km3) of undiscovered, technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the Alaskan North Slope.", "Alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers.", "Large swaths of the Alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well.", "Alaska's economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating, transportation, electric power and light.", "Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special low-cost electric interties) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50\u00a2/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.", "The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30\u201360\u00a2 higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.", "The Alaska Permanent Fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the recently constructed Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.", "The fund was originally proposed by Governor Keith Miller on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once.", "It was later championed by Governor Jay Hammond and Kenai state representative Hugh Malone.", "It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.", "The Alaska Constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose.", "The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation.", "From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.", "Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska.", "This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.", "Starting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\").", "Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans.", "To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences, and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.", "The Tanana Valley is another notable agricultural locus, especially the Delta Junction area, about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of Fort Greely.", "This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor.", "Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay.", "West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and community-supported agriculture.", "Most food in Alaska is transported into the state from \"Outside\", and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive.", "In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive.", "Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes.", "The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions.", "The cost of delivering a 1 US gallon (3.8 L) of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less.", "Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20\u201330\u00a2 higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.", "Alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada.", "The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from Haines.", "The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.", "Built around 1915, the Alaska Railroad (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century.", "It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from Seward to Interior Alaska by way of South Central Alaska, passing through Anchorage, Eklutna, Wasilla, Talkeetna, Denali, and Fairbanks, with spurs to Whittier, Palmer and North Pole.", "The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\".", "In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.", "The Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains.", "It continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country.", "A stretch of about 60 miles (100 km) of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area.", "Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.", "Alaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the Alaska Marine Highway) serves the cities of southeast, the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula.", "The ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers.", "The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington and Prince Rupert, British Columbia in Canada through the Inside Passage to Skagway.", "The Inter-Island Ferry Authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the Prince of Wales Island region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.", "Cities not served by road, sea, or river can be reached only by air, foot, dogsled, or snowmachine, accounting for Alaska's extremely well developed bush air services\u2014an Alaskan novelty.", "Anchorage and, to a lesser extent Fairbanks, is served by many major airlines.", "Because of limited highway access, air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state.", "Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (in 2012-2013, Alaska received almost 2 million visitors).", "Regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide, so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the Essential Air Service program.", "Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-400s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities.", "The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as Ravn Alaska, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service.", "The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state.", "Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities.", "The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.", "Many communities have small air taxi services.", "These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas.", "Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane.", "The world's busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs.", "In 2006 Alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any U.S. state.", "Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled.", "In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation.", "Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km).", "The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed.", "Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige.", "The \"Serum Run\" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome.", "Alaska's internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies: GCI and Alaska Communications.", "GCI owns and operates what it calls the Alaska United Fiber Optic system and as of late 2011 Alaska Communications advertised that it has \"two fiber optic paths to the lower 48 and two more across Alaska.", "In January 2011, it was reported that a $1 billion project to run connect Asia and rural Alaska was being planned, aided in part by $350 million in stimulus from the federal government.", "To finance state government operations, Alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies.", "This allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the United States.", "It is one of five states with no state sales tax, one of seven states that do not levy an individual income tax, and one of the two states that has neither.", "The Department of Revenue Tax Division reports regularly on the state's revenue sources.", "The Department also issues an annual summary of its operations, including new state laws that directly affect the tax division.", "Alaska regularly supports Republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood.", "Republicans have won the state's electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in (1964).", "No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times.", "Alaska was carried by Democratic nominee Lyndon B. Johnson during his landslide election in 1964, while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close.", "Since 1972, however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins.", "In 2008, Republican John McCain defeated Democrat Barack Obama in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%.", "McCain's running mate was Sarah Palin, the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket.", "Obama lost Alaska again in 2012, but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.", "The Alaska Bush, central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party.", "The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing.", "As of 2004[update], well over half of all registered voters have chosen \"Non-Partisan\" or \"Undeclared\" as their affiliation, despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.", "The Unorganized Borough has no government of its own, but the U.S. Census Bureau in cooperation with the state divided the Unorganized Borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation.", "A recording district is a mechanism for administration of the public record in Alaska.", "The state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a State Recorder.", "All recording districts use the same acceptance criteria, fee schedule, etc., for accepting documents into the public record.", "As reflected in the 2010 United States Census, Alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census-designated places (CDPs).", "The tally of cities includes four unified municipalities, essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city\u2013county.", "The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"The Bush\" and are unconnected to the contiguous North American road network.", "The table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.", "Of Alaska's 2010 Census population figure of 710,231, 20,429 people, or 2.88% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place.", "Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla.", "CDPs have not been established for these areas by the United States Census Bureau, except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 Census (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North Tongass Highway, Pennock Island and Saxman East), but have not been used since.", "The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the Unorganized Borough, in largely remote areas.", "The Alaska State Troopers are Alaska's statewide police force.", "They have a long and storied history, but were not an official organization until 1941.", "Before the force was officially organized, law enforcement in Alaska was handled by various federal agencies.", "Larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on \"Public Safety Officers\" who have police training but do not carry firearms.", "In much of the state, the troopers serve as the only police force available.", "In addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law, wildlife Troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations.", "Due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the Troopers' duties, they employ a wide variety of land, air, and water patrol vehicles.", "There are many established music festivals in Alaska, including the Alaska Folk Festival, the Fairbanks Summer Arts Festival, the Anchorage Folk Festival, the Athabascan Old-Time Fiddling Festival, the Sitka Jazz Festival, and the Sitka Summer Music Festival.", "The most prominent orchestra in Alaska is the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra, though the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and Juneau Symphony are also notable.", "The Anchorage Opera is currently the state's only professional opera company, though there are several volunteer and semi-professional organizations in the state as well.", "One of the most prominent movies filmed in Alaska is MGM's Eskimo/Mala The Magnificent, starring Alaska Native Ray Mala.", "In 1932 an expedition set out from MGM's studios in Hollywood to Alaska to film what was then billed as \"The Biggest Picture Ever Made.\"", "Upon arriving in Alaska, they set up \"Camp Hollywood\" in Northwest Alaska, where they lived during the duration of the filming.", "Louis B.

of whether this is permitted is really a question of how other states will react to the withdrawal; for instance, another state might impose sanctions or go to war over a treaty violation.", "If a state party's withdrawal is successful, its obligations under that treaty are considered terminated, and withdrawal by one party from a bilateral treaty of course terminates the treaty.", "When a state withdraws from a multi-lateral treaty, that treaty will still otherwise remain in force among the other parties, unless, of course, otherwise should or could be interpreted as agreed upon between the remaining states parties to the treaty.", "[citation needed]", "If a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.", "A material breach may also be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty itself.", "A treaty breach does not automatically suspend or terminate treaty relations, however.", "It depends on how the other parties regard the breach and how they resolve to respond to it.", "Sometimes treaties will provide for the seriousness of a breach to be determined by a tribunal or other independent arbiter.", "An advantage of such an arbiter is that it prevents a party from prematurely and perhaps wrongfully suspending or terminating its own obligations due to another's alleged material breach.", "Treaties sometimes include provisions for self-termination, meaning that the treaty is automatically terminated if certain defined conditions are met.", "Some treaties are intended by the parties to be only temporarily binding and are set to expire on a given date.", "Other treaties may self-terminate if the treaty is meant to exist only under certain conditions.", "[citation needed]", "A party may claim that a treaty should be terminated, even absent an express provision, if there has been a fundamental change in circumstances.", "Such a change is sufficient if unforeseen, if it undermined the \u201cessential basis\u201d of consent by a party, if it radically transforms the extent of obligations between the parties, and if the obligations are still to be performed.", "A party cannot base this claim on change brought about by its own breach of the treaty.", "This claim also cannot be used to invalidate treaties that established or redrew political boundaries.", "[citation needed]", "The Islamic Prophet Muhammad carried out a siege against the Banu Qaynuqa tribe known as the Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa in February 624  Muhammad ordered his followers to attack the Banu Qaynuqa Jews for allegedly breaking the treaty known as the Constitution of Medina by pinning the clothes of a Muslim woman, which led to her being stripped naked As a result, a Muslim killed a Jew in retaliation, and the Jews in turn killed the Muslim man.", "This escalated to a chain of revenge killings, and enmity grew between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa, leading to the siege of their fortress.", ":122 The tribe eventually surrendered to Muhammad, who initially wanted to kill the members of Banu Qaynuqa but ultimately yielded to Abdullah ibn Ubayy's insistence and agreed to expel the Qaynuqa.", "Muhammad also ordered another siege on the Banu Qurayza during the Invasion of Banu Qurayza, because according to Muslim tradition he had been ordered to do so by the angel Gabriel.", "Al-Waqidi claims Muhammad had a treaty with the tribe which was torn apart.", "Stillman and Watt deny the authenticity of al-Waqidi.", "Al-Waqidi has been frequently criticized by Muslim writers, who claim that he is unreliable. 600-900 members of the Banu Qurayza were beheaded after they surrendered (according to Tabari and Ibn Hisham).", "Another source says all Males and 1 woman beheaded (according to Sunni Hadith).", "Two Muslims were killed", "There are several reasons an otherwise valid and agreed upon treaty may be rejected as a binding international agreement, most of which involve problems created at the formation of the treaty.", "[citation needed] For example, the serial Japan-Korea treaties of 1905, 1907 and 1910 were protested; and they were confirmed as \"already null and void\" in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea.", "A party's consent to a treaty is invalid if it had been given by an agent or body without power to do so under that state's domestic law.", "States are reluctant to inquire into the internal affairs and processes of other states, and so a \"manifest violation\" is required such that it would be \"objectively evident to any State dealing with the matter\".", "A strong presumption exists internationally that a head of state has acted within his proper authority.", "It seems that no treaty has ever actually been invalidated on this provision.", "[citation needed]", "Consent is also invalid if it is given by a representative who ignored restrictions he is subject to by his sovereign during the negotiations, if the other parties to the treaty were notified of those restrictions prior to his signing.", "[citation needed]", "According to the preamble in The Law of Treaties, treaties are a source of international law.", "If an act or lack thereof is condemned under international law, the act will not assume international legality even if approved by internal law.", "This means that in case of a conflict with domestic law, international law will always prevail.", "Articles 46\u201353 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties set out the only ways that treaties can be invalidated\u2014considered unenforceable and void under international law.", "A treaty will be invalidated due to either the circumstances by which a state party joined the treaty, or due to the content of the treaty itself.", "Invalidation is separate from withdrawal, suspension, or termination (addressed above), which all involve an alteration in the consent of the parties of a previously valid treaty rather than the invalidation of that consent in the first place.", "A state's consent may be invalidated if there was an erroneous understanding of a fact or situation at the time of conclusion, which formed the \"essential basis\" of the state's consent.", "Consent will not be invalidated if the misunderstanding was due to the state's own conduct, or if the truth should have been evident.", "Consent will also be invalidated if it was induced by the fraudulent conduct of another party, or by the direct or indirect \"corruption\" of its representative by another party to the treaty.", "Coercion of either a representative, or the state itself through the threat or use of force, if used to obtain the consent of that state to a treaty, will invalidate that consent.", "A treaty is null and void if it is in violation of a peremptory norm.", "These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations.", "These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, genocide and other crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed at civilian population, racial discrimination and apartheid, slavery and torture, meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.", "The United Nations Charter states that treaties must be registered with the UN to be invoked before it or enforced in its judiciary organ, the International Court of Justice.", "This was done to prevent the proliferation of secret treaties that occurred in the 19th and 20th century.", "Section 103 of the Charter also states that its members' obligations under it outweigh any competing obligations under other treaties.", "After their adoption, treaties as well as their amendments have to follow the official legal procedures of the United Nations, as applied by the Office of Legal Affairs, including signature, ratification and entry into force.", "In function and effectiveness, the UN has been compared to the pre-Constitutional United States Federal government by some[citation needed], giving a comparison between modern treaty law and the historical Articles of Confederation.", "The Brazilian federal constitution states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president and that such treaties must be approved by Congress (articles 84, clause VIII, and 49, clause I).", "In practice, this has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty, but its ratification by the president is contingent upon the prior approval of Congress.", "Additionally, the Federal Supreme Court has ruled that, following ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register in order to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.", "The Federal Supreme Court has established that treaties are subject to constitutional review and enjoy the same hierarchical position as ordinary legislation (leis ordin\u00e1rias, or \"ordinary laws\", in Portuguese).", "A more recent ruling by the Supreme Court in 2008 has altered that scheme somewhat, by stating that treaties containing human rights provisions enjoy a status above that of ordinary legislation, though they remain beneath the constitution itself.", "Additionally, as per the 45th amendment to the constitution, human rights treaties which are approved by Congress by means of a special procedure enjoy the same hierarchical position as a constitutional amendment.", "The hierarchical position of treaties in relation to domestic legislation is of relevance to the discussion on whether (and how) the latter can abrogate the former and vice versa.", "The Brazilian federal constitution does not have a supremacy clause with the same effects as the one on the U.S. constitution, a fact that is of interest to the discussion on the relation between treaties and state legislation.", "In the United States, the term \"treaty\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law.", "United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements.", "All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law.", "The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval.", "Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone.", "Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols.", "And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.", "Currently, international agreements are executed by executive agreement rather than treaties at a rate of 10:1.", "Despite the relative ease of executive agreements, the President still often chooses to pursue the formal treaty process over an executive agreement in order to gain congressional support on matters that require the Congress to pass implementing legislation or appropriate funds, and those agreements that impose long-term, complex legal obligations on the United States.", "For example, the deal by the United States, Iran and other countries is not a Treaty.", "The Supreme Court ruled in the Head Money Cases that \"treaties\" do not have a privileged position over Acts of Congress and can be repealed or modified (for the purposes of U.S. law) by any subsequent Act of Congress, just like with any other regular law.", "The Supreme Court also ruled in Reid v. Covert that any treaty provision that conflicts with the Constitution are null and void under U.S. law.", "In India, the legislation subjects are divided into 3 lists -Union List, State List and Concurrent List .", "In the normal legislation process, the subjects in Union list can only be legislated upon by central legislative body called Parliament of India, for subjects in state list only respective state legislature can legislate.", "While for Concurrent subjects, both center and state can make laws.", "But to implement international treaties, Parliament can legislate on any subject overriding the general division of subject lists.", "Treaties formed an important part of European colonization and, in many parts of the world, Europeans attempted to legitimize their sovereignty by signing treaties with indigenous peoples.", "In most cases these treaties were in extremely disadvantageous terms to the native people, who often did not appreciate the implications of what they were signing.", "In some rare cases, such as with Ethiopia and Qing Dynasty China, the local governments were able to use the treaties to at least mitigate the impact of European colonization.", "This involved learning the intricacies of European diplomatic customs and then using the treaties to prevent a power from overstepping their agreement or by playing different powers against each other.", "In other cases, such as New Zealand and Canada, treaties allowed native peoples to maintain a minimum amount of autonomy.", "In the case of indigenous Australians, unlike with the M\u0101ori of New Zealand, no treaty was ever entered into with the indigenous peoples entitling the Europeans to land ownership, under the doctrine of terra nullius (later overturned by Mabo v Queensland, establishing the concept of native title well after colonization was already a fait accompli).", "Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of political discourse in the late 20th and early 21st century, the treaties being discussed have international standing as has been stated in a treaty study by the UN.", "Prior to 1871, the government of the United States regularly entered into treaties with Native Americans but the Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1871 (ch. 120, 16 Stat. 563) had a rider (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 71) attached that effectively ended the President\u2019s treaty making by providing that no Indian nation or tribe shall be acknowledged as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty.", "The federal government continued to provide similar contractual relations with the Indian tribes after 1871 by agreements, statutes, and executive orders."]}, {"qa": [{"question": "Where was the band Blue

distinct from the mainstream Marvel Universe, were a solid success amidst a generally struggling industry, but Marvel discontinued the experiment after a one-year run and returned the characters to the Marvel Universe proper.", "In 1998, the company launched the imprint Marvel Knights, taking place within Marvel continuity; helmed by soon-to-become editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, it featured tough,

1940, the region around Bia\u0142ystok and a minor part of Galicia east of the San river around Przemy\u015bl were returned to the Polish state at the end of World War II.", "Of all other territories

ruled by \"Jewish Bolshevik\" masters.", "In 1934, Hitler himself had spoken of an inescapable battle against both Pan-Slavism and Neo-Slavism, the victory in which would lead to \"permanent mastery of the world\", though he stated that they would \"walk part of the road with the Russians, if that will help us.\"", "The resulting manifestation of German anti-Bolshevism and an increase in Soviet

conducted by Chamberlain's and Daladier's cabinets.", "This policy immediately raised the question of whether the Soviet Union could avoid being next on Hitler's list.", "The Soviet leadership

either that war could be avoided, or faith in the Polish army, and wanted nothing less than an ironclad military alliance with France and Britain that would provide a guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany; thus, Stalin's adherence to the collective security line was purely conditional.", "Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided, and that the Soviet Union, weakened by the Great Purge, could not be a main military participant, a point that many military sources were at variance with, especially Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung army on the Manchurian frontier.", "France was more anxious to find an agreement with the USSR than was Britain; as a continental power, it was more willing to make concessions, more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany.", "These contrasting attitudes partly explain why the USSR has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939: carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France while secretly considering propositions from Germany.", "By the end of May, drafts were formally presented.", "In mid-June, the main Tripartite negotiations started.",

the Baltic states would constitute an \"indirect aggression\" towards the Soviet Union.", "Britain opposed such proposals, because they feared the Soviets' proposed language could justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states, or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany.", "The discussion about a definition of \"indirect aggression\" became one of the sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite political negotiations effectively stalled, while the parties agreed to start negotiations on a military agreement, which the Soviets insisted must be entered into simultaneously with any political agreement.", "From April\u2013July, Soviet and German officials made statements regarding the potential for the beginning of political negotiations, while no actual negotiations took place during that time period.", "The ensuing discussion of a potential political deal between Germany and the Soviet Union had to be channeled into the framework of economic negotiations between the two countries, because close military and diplomatic connections, as was the case before the mid-1930s, had afterward been largely severed.", "In May, Stalin replaced his Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, who was regarded as pro-western and who was also Jewish, with Vyacheslav Molotov, allowing the Soviet Union more latitude in discussions with more parties, not only with Britain and France.", "At the same time, British, French, and Soviet negotiators scheduled three-party talks on military matters to occur in Moscow in August 1939, aiming to define what the agreement would specify should be the reaction of the three powers to a German attack.", "The tripartite military talks, started in mid-August, hit a sticking point regarding the passage of Soviet troops through Poland if Germans attacked, and the parties waited as British and French officials overseas pressured Polish officials to agree to such terms.", "Polish officials

engines, ships, machine tools and samples of German artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment and other items.", "The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk.", "This also provided a refueling and maintenance location, and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping.",

join the Axis.", "That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the Soviet Union's dissolution.", "For decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the Soviet\u2013German Pact.", "At the behest of Mikhail Gorbachev, Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol.", "In December 1989, the commission concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed its findings to the Congress of

Litvinov, whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by Nazi Germany, removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany.", "Stalin immediately directed Molotov to \"purge the ministry of Jews.\"", "Given Litvinov's prior attempts to create an anti-fascist coalition, association with the doctrine of collective security with France and Britain, and pro-Western orientation by the standards of the Kremlin, his dismissal indicated the existence of a Soviet option of rapprochement with Germany.", "[f] Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers.", "The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany.", "One British official wrote that Litvinov's disappearance also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's \"modus operandi\" was \"more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan.\"", "Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat.", "Historian Albert Resis stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British\u2013French talks.", "Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany.", "Geoffrey Roberts argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British\u2013French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.", "Edward Hallett Carr, a frequent defender of Soviet policy, stated: \"In return for 'non-intervention' Stalin secured a breathing space of

underneath, is made of tough but flexible collagen and does not molt \u2013 on the other hand arthropods' cuticles are made of the more rigid \u03b1-chitin, and molt until the arthropods reach their full size.", "Most annelids have closed circulatory systems, where the blood makes its entire circuit via blood vessels.", "Most of an annelid's body consists of segments that are practically

them are longitudinal muscles, usually four distinct strips, whose contractions make the segment shorter and fatter.", "Some annelids also have oblique internal muscles that connect the underside of the body to each side.", "The setae (\"hairs\") of annelids project out from the epidermis to provide traction and other capabilities.", "The simplest are unjointed and form paired bundles near the

cheta.", "The chetoblasts produce chetae by forming microvilli, fine hair-like extensions that increase the area available for secreting the cheta.", "When the cheta is complete, the microvilli withdraw into the chetoblast, leaving parallel tunnels that run almost the full length of the cheta.", "Hence annelids' chetae are structurally different from the setae (\"bristles\") of arthropods, which are made of the more rigid \u03b1-chitin, have a single internal cavity, and are mounted on flexible joints in shallow pits in the cuticle.", "Nearly all polychaetes have parapodia that function

cilia) and gills.", "The brain generally forms a ring round the pharynx (throat), consisting of a pair of ganglia (local control centers) above and in front of the pharynx, linked by nerve cords either side of the pharynx to another pair of ganglia just below and behind it.", "The brains of polychaetes are generally in the prostomium, while those of clitellates are in the peristomium or sometimes the first segment behind the peristomium.", "In some very mobile and active polychaetes the brain is enlarged and more complex, with visible hindbrain, midbrain and forebrain sections.", "The rest of the central nervous system is generally \"ladder-like\", consisting of a pair of nerve cords that run through the bottom part of the body and have in each segment paired ganglia linked by a transverse connection.", "From each segmental ganglion a branching system of local nerves runs into the body wall and then encircles the body.", "However, in most polychaetes the two main nerve cords are fused, and in the tube-dwelling genus Owenia the single nerve chord has no ganglia and is located in the epidermis.", "As in arthropods, each muscle fiber (cell) is controlled by more than one neuron, and the speed and power of the fiber's contractions depends on the combined effects of all its neurons.", "Vertebrates have a different system, in which one neuron controls a group of muscle fibers.", "Most annelids' longitudinal nerve trunks include giant axons (the output signal lines of nerve cells).", "Their large diameter decreases their resistance, which allows them to transmit signals exceptionally fast.", "This enables these worms to withdraw rapidly from danger by shortening their bodies.", "Experiments have shown that cutting the giant axons prevents this escape response but does not affect normal movement.", "The sensors are primarily single cells that detect light, chemicals, pressure waves and contact, and are present on the head, appendages (if any) and other parts of the body.", "Nuchal (\"on the neck\") organs are paired, ciliated structures found only in polychaetes, and are thought to be chemosensors.", "Some polychaetes also have various combinations of ocelli (\"little eyes\") that detect the direction from which light is coming and camera eyes or compound eyes that can probably form images.", "The compound eyes probably evolved independently of arthropods' eyes.", "Some tube-worms use ocelli widely spread over their bodies to detect the shadows of fish, so that they can quickly withdraw into their tubes.", "Some burrowing and tube-dwelling polychaetes have statocysts (tilt and balance sensors) that tell them which way is down.", "A few polychaete genera have on the undersides of their heads palps that are used both in feeding and as \"feelers\", and some of these also have antennae that are structurally similar but probably are used mainly as \"feelers\".", "Most annelids have a pair of coelomata (body cavities) in each segment, separated from other segments by septa and from each other by vertical mesenteries.", "Each septum forms a sandwich with connective tissue in the middle and mesothelium (membrane that serves as a lining) from the preceding and following segments on either side.", "Each mesentery is similar except that the mesothelium is the lining of each of the pair of coelomata, and the blood vessels and, in polychaetes, the main nerve cords are embedded in it.", "The mesothelium is made of modified epitheliomuscular cells; in other words, their bodies form part of the epithelium but their bases extend to form muscle fibers in the body wall.", "The mesothelium may also form radial and circular muscles on the septa, and circular muscles around the blood vessels and gut.", "Parts of the mesothelium, especially on the outside of the gut, may also form chloragogen cells that perform similar functions to the livers of vertebrates: producing and storing glycogen and fat; producing the oxygen-carrier hemoglobin; breaking down proteins; and turning nitrogenous waste products into ammonia and urea to be excreted.", "Many annelids move by peristalsis (waves of contraction and expansion that sweep along the body), or flex the body while using parapodia to crawl or swim.", "In these animals the septa enable the circular and longitudinal muscles to change the shape of individual segments, by making each segment a separate fluid-filled \"balloon\".", "However, the septa are often incomplete in annelids that are semi-sessile or that do not move by peristalsis or by movements of parapodia \u2013 for example some move by whipping movements of the body, some small marine species move by means of cilia (fine muscle-powered hairs) and some burrowers turn their pharynges (throats) inside out to penetrate the sea-floor and drag themselves into it.", "The fluid in the coelomata contains coelomocyte cells that defend the animals against parasites and infections.", "In some species coelomocytes may also contain a respiratory pigment \u2013 red hemoglobin in some species, green chlorocruorin in others (dissolved in the plasma) \u2013 and provide oxygen transport within their segments.", "Respiratory pigment is also dissolved in the blood plasma.", "Species with well-developed septa generally also have blood vessels running all long their bodies above and below the gut, the upper one carrying blood forwards while the lower one carries it backwards.", "Networks of capillaries in the body wall and around the gut transfer blood between the main blood vessels and to parts of the segment that need oxygen and nutrients.", "Both of the major vessels, especially the upper one, can pump blood by contracting.", "In some annelids the forward end of the upper blood vessel is enlarged with muscles to form a heart, while in the forward ends of many earthworms some of the vessels that connect the upper and lower main vessels function as hearts.", "Species with poorly developed or no septa generally have no blood vessels and rely on the circulation within the coelom for delivering nutrients and oxygen.", "However, leeches and their closest relatives have a body structure that is very uniform within the group but significantly different from that of other annelids, including other members of the Clitellata.", "In leeches there are no septa, the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body, and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body.", "They function as the main blood vessels, although they are side-by-side rather than upper and lower.", "However, they are lined with mesothelium, like the coelomata and unlike the blood vessels of other annelids.", "Leeches generally use suckers at their front and rear ends to move like inchworms.", "The anus is on the upper surface of the pygidium.", "Feeding structures in the mouth region vary widely, and have little correlation with the animals' diets.", "Many polychaetes have a muscular pharynx that can be everted (turned inside out to extend it).", "In these animals the foremost few segments often lack septa so that, when the muscles in these segments contract, the sharp increase in fluid pressure from all these segments everts the pharynx very quickly.", "Two families, the Eunicidae and Phyllodocidae, have evolved jaws, which can be used for seizing prey, biting off pieces of vegetation, or grasping dead and decaying matter.", "On the other hand, some predatory polychaetes have neither jaws nor eversible pharynges.", "Selective deposit feeders generally live in tubes on the sea-floor and use palps to find food particles in the sediment and then wipe them into their mouths.", "Filter feeders use \"crowns\" of palps covered in cilia that wash food particles towards their mouths.", "Non-selective deposit feeders ingest soil or marine sediments via mouths that are generally unspecialized.", "Some clitellates have sticky pads in the roofs of their mouths, and some of these can evert the pads to capture prey.", "Leeches often have an eversible proboscis, or a muscular pharynx with two or three teeth.", "The gut is generally an almost straight tube supported by the mesenteries (vertical partitions within segments), and ends with the anus on the underside of the pygidium.", "However, in members of the tube-dwelling family Siboglinidae the gut is blocked by a swollen lining that houses symbiotic bacteria, which can make up 15% of the worms' total weight.", "The bacteria convert inorganic matter \u2013 such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from hydrothermal vents, or methane from seeps \u2013 to organic matter that feeds themselves and their hosts, while the worms extend their palps into the gas flows to absorb the gases needed by the bacteria.", "Annelids with blood vessels use metanephridia to remove soluble waste products, while those without use protonephridia.", "Both of these systems use a two-stage filtration process, in which fluid and waste products are first extracted and these are filtered again to re-absorb any re-usable materials while dumping toxic and spent materials as urine.", "The difference is that protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ, while metanephridia perform only the second filtration and rely on other mechanisms for the first \u2013 in annelids special filter cells in the walls of the blood vessels let fluids and other small molecules pass into the coelomic fluid, where it circulates to the metanephridia.", "In annelids the points at which fluid enters the protonephridia or metanephridia are on the forward side of a septum while the second-stage filter and the nephridiopore (exit opening in the body wall) are in the following segment.", "As a result, the hindmost segment (before the growth zone and pygidium) has no structure that extracts its wastes, as there is no following segment to filter and discharge them, while the first segment contains an extraction structure that passes wastes to the second, but does not contain the structures that re-filter and discharge urine.", "It is thought that annelids were originally animals with two separate sexes, which released ova and sperm into the water via their nephridia.", "The fertilized eggs develop into trochophore larvae, which live as plankton.", "Later they sink to the sea-floor and metamorphose into miniature adults: the part of the trochophore between the apical tuft and the prototroch becomes the prostomium (head); a small area round the trochophore's anus becomes the pygidium (tail-piece); a narrow band immediately in front of that becomes the growth zone that produces new segments; and the rest of the trochophore becomes the peristomium (the segment that contains the mouth).", "However, the lifecycles of most living polychaetes, which are almost all marine animals, are unknown, and only about 25% of the 300+ species whose lifecycles are known follow this pattern.", "About 14% use a similar external fertilization but produce yolk-rich eggs, which reduce the time the larva needs to spend among the plankton, or eggs from which miniature adults emerge rather than larvae.", "The rest care for the fertilized eggs until they hatch \u2013 some by producing jelly-covered masses of eggs which they tend, some by attaching the eggs to their bodies and a few species by keeping the eggs within their bodies until they hatch.", "These species use a variety of methods for sperm transfer; for example, in some the females collect sperm released into the water, while in others the males have a penis that inject sperm into the female.", "There is no guarantee that this is a representative sample of polychaetes' reproductive patterns, and it simply reflects scientists' current knowledge.", "Some polychaetes breed only once in their lives, while others breed almost continuously or through several breeding seasons.", "While most polychaetes remain of one sex all their lives, a significant percentage of species are full hermaphrodites or change sex during their lives.", "Most polychaetes whose reproduction has been studied lack permanent gonads, and it is uncertain how they produce ova and sperm.", "In a few species the rear of the body splits off and becomes a separate individual that lives just long enough to swim to a suitable environment, usually near the surface, and spawn.", "Most mature clitellates (the group that includes earthworms and leeches) are full hermaphrodites, although in a few leech species younger adults function as males and become female at maturity.", "All have well-developed gonads, and all copulate.", "Earthworms store their partners' sperm in spermathecae (\"sperm stores\") and then the clitellum produces a cocoon that collects ova from the ovaries and then sperm from the spermathecae.", "Fertilization and development of earthworm eggs takes place in the cocoon.", "Leeches' eggs are fertilized in the ovaries, and then transferred to the cocoon.", "In all clitellates the cocoon also either produces yolk when the eggs are fertilized or nutrients while they are developing.", "All clitellates hatch as miniature adults rather than larvae.", "Charles Darwin's book The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms (1881) presented the first scientific analysis of earthworms' contributions to soil fertility.", "Some burrow while others live entirely on the surface, generally in moist leaf litter.", "The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it, and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter, by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms, and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily.", "Earthworms are also important prey for birds ranging in size from robins to storks, and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers, and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds.", "Terrestrial annelids can be invasive in some situations.", "In the glaciated areas of North America, for example, almost all native earthworms are thought to have been killed by the glaciers and the worms currently found in those areas are all introduced from other areas, primarily from Europe, and, more recently, from Asia.", "Northern hardwood forests are especially negatively impacted by invasive worms through the loss of leaf duff, soil fertility, changes in soil chemistry and the loss of ecological diversity.", "Especially of concern is Amynthas agrestis and at least one state (Wisconsin) has listed it as a prohibited species.", "Earthworms make a significant contribution to soil fertility.", "The rear end of the Palolo worm, a marine polychaete that tunnels through coral, detaches in order to spawn at the surface, and the people of Samoa regard these spawning modules as a delicacy.", "Anglers sometimes find that worms are more effective bait than artificial flies, and worms can be kept for several days in a tin lined with damp moss.", "Ragworms are commercially important as bait and as food sources for aquaculture, and there have been proposals to farm them in order to reduce over-fishing of their natural populations.", "Some marine polychaetes' predation on molluscs causes serious losses to fishery and aquaculture operations.", "Accounts of the use of leeches for the medically dubious practise of blood-letting have come from China around 30 AD, India around 200 AD, ancient Rome around 50 AD and later throughout Europe.", "In the 19th century medical demand for leeches was so high that some areas' stocks were exhausted and other regions imposed restrictions or bans on exports, and Hirudo medicinalis is treated as an endangered species by both IUCN and CITES.", "More recently leeches have been used to assist in microsurgery, and their saliva has provided anti-inflammatory compounds and several important anticoagulants, one of which also prevents tumors from spreading.", "Since annelids are soft-bodied, their fossils are rare.", "Polychaetes' fossil record consists mainly of the jaws that some species had and the mineralized tubes that some secreted.", "Some Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia in some ways resemble polychaetes, but the similarities are too vague for these fossils to be classified with confidence.", "The small shelly fossil Cloudina, from 549 to 542 million years ago, has been classified by some authors as an annelid, but by others as a cnidarian (i.e. in the phylum to which jellyfish and sea anemones belong).", "Until 2008 the earliest fossils widely accepted as annelids were the polychaetes Canadia and Burgessochaeta, both from Canada's Burgess Shale, formed about 505 million years ago in the early Cambrian.", "Myoscolex, found in Australia and a little older than the Burgess Shale, was possibly an annelid.", "However, it lacks some typical annelid features and has features which are not usually found in annelids and some of which are associated with other phyla.", "Then Simon Conway Morris and John Peel reported Phragmochaeta from Sirius Passet, about 518 million years old, and concluded that it was the oldest annelid known to date.", "There has been vigorous debate about whether the Burgess Shale fossil Wiwaxia was a mollusc or an annelid.", "Polychaetes diversified in the early Ordovician, about 488 to 474 million years ago.", "It is not until the early Ordovician that the first annelid jaws are found, thus the crown-group cannot have appeared before this date and probably appeared somewhat later.", "By the end of the Carboniferous, about 299 million years ago, fossils of most of the modern mobile polychaete groups had appeared.", "Many fossil tubes look like those made by modern sessile polychaetes  , but the first tubes clearly produced by polychaetes date from the Jurassic, less than 199 million years ago.", "The earliest good evidence for oligochaetes occurs in the Tertiary period, which began 65 million years ago, and it has been suggested that these animals evolved around the same time as flowering plants in the early Cretaceous, from 130 to 90 million years ago.", "A trace fossil consisting of a convoluted burrow partly filled with small fecal pellets may be evidence that earthworms were present in the early Triassic period from 251 to 245 million years ago.", "Body fossils going back to the mid Ordovician, from 472 to 461 million years ago, have been tentatively classified as oligochaetes, but these identifications are uncertain and some have been disputed.", "Traditionally the annelids have been divided into two major groups, the polychaetes and clitellates.", "In turn the clitellates were divided into oligochaetes, which include earthworms, and hirudinomorphs, whose best-known members are leeches.", "For many years there was no clear arrangement of the approximately 80 polychaete families into higher-level groups.", "In 1997 Greg Rouse and Kristian Fauchald attempted a \"first heuristic step in terms of bringing polychaete systematics to an acceptable level of rigour\", based on anatomical structures, and divided polychaetes into:", "In 2007 Torsten Struck and colleagues compared 3 genes in 81 taxa, of which 9 were outgroups, in other words not considered closely related to annelids but included to give an indication of where the organisms under study are placed on the larger tree of life.", "For a cross-check the study used an analysis of 11 genes (including the original 3) in 10 taxa.", "This analysis agreed that clitellates, pogonophorans and echiurans were on various branches of the polychaete family tree.", "It also concluded that the classification of polychaetes into Scolecida, Canalipalpata and Aciculata was useless, as the members of these alleged groups were scattered all over the family tree derived from comparing the 81 taxa.", "In addition, it also placed sipunculans, generally regarded at the time as a separate phylum, on another branch of the polychaete tree, and concluded that leeches were a sub-group of oligochaetes rather than their sister-group among the clitellates.", "Rouse accepted the analyses based on molecular phylogenetics, and their main conclusions are now the scientific consensus, although the details of the annelid family tree remain uncertain.", "In addition to re-writing the classification of annelids and 3 previously independent phyla, the molecular phylogenetics analyses undermine the emphasis that decades of previous writings placed on the importance of segmentation in the classification of invertebrates.", "Polychaetes, which these analyses found to be the parent group, have completely segmented bodies, while polychaetes' echiurans and sipunculan offshoots are not segmented and pogonophores are segmented only in the rear parts of their bodies.", "It now seems that segmentation can appear and disappear much more easily in the course of evolution than was previously thought.", "The 2007 study also noted that the ladder-like nervous system, which is associated with segmentation, is less universal previously thought in both annelids and arthropods.", "[n 2]", "Annelids are members of the protostomes, one of the two major superphyla of bilaterian animals \u2013 the other is the deuterostomes, which includes vertebrates.", "Within the protostomes, annelids used to be grouped with arthropods under the super-group Articulata (\"jointed animals\"), as segmentation is obvious in most members of both phyla.", "However, the genes that drive segmentation in arthropods do not appear to do the same in annelids.", "Arthropods and annelids both have close relatives that are unsegmented.", "It is at least as easy to assume that they evolved segmented bodies independently as it is to assume that the ancestral protostome or bilaterian was segmented and that segmentation disappeared in many descendant phyla.", "The current view is that annelids are grouped with molluscs, brachiopods and several other phyla that have lophophores (fan-like feeding structures) and/or trochophore larvae as members of Lophotrochozoa.", "Bryzoa may be the most basal phylum (the one that first became distinctive) within the Lophotrochozoa, and the relationships between the other members are not yet known.", "Arthropods are now regarded as members of the Ecdysozoa (\"animals that molt\"), along with some phyla that are unsegmented.", "The \"Lophotrochozoa\" hypothesis is also supported by the fact that many phyla within this group, including annelids, molluscs, nemerteans and flatworms, follow a similar pattern in the fertilized egg's development.", "When their cells divide after the 4-cell stage, descendants of these 4 cells form a spiral pattern.", "In these phyla the \"fates\" of the embryo's cells, in other words the roles their descendants will play in the adult animal, are the same and can be predicted from a very early stage.", "Hence this development pattern is often described as \"spiral determinate cleavage\"."]}, {"qa": [{"question": "On What date was Pope Paul VI born?", "id": 3172}, {"question": "On what date

funding).", "With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence

be measured by interest rates or fees.", "Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis, enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have, and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward, readily understandable format.", "For a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its impact on the overall stability of the financial system.", "For example, the pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system.", "Banks estimated that $450bn of CDO were sold between \"late 2005 to the middle of 2007\"; among the $102bn of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for \"high quality\" CDOs was approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for mezzanine CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.", "Another example relates to AIG, which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps.", "The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted.", "However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008.", "U.S. taxpayers provided over $180 billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.", "As financial assets became more and more complex, and harder and harder to value, investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators, who came to rely on them, accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be.", "George Soros commented that \"The super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods

and worldwide recession, while The New York Times labelled him \"Dr. Doom\".", "Stock trader and financial risk engineer Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the 2007 book The Black Swan, spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of bad risk models and reliance on forecasting, and their reliance on bad models, and framed the problem as part of \"robustness and fragility\".", "He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis (\"They didn't listen, so I took their money\").", "According to David Brooks from the New York Times, \"Taleb not only has an explanation for what\u2019s happening, he saw it coming.\"", "Market strategist Phil Dow believes distinctions exist \"between the current market malaise\" and the Great Depression.", "He says the Dow Jones average's fall of more than 50% over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7% fall in the Great Depression, followed by a total drop of 89% over the following 16 months.", "\"It's very troubling if you have a mirror image,\" said Dow.", "Floyd Norris, the chief financial correspondent of The New York Times, wrote in a blog entry in March 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the Great Depression, explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time, the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007, and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the Dow.", "The past two years ranked third, however.", "One of the first victims was Northern Rock, a medium-sized British bank.", "The highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the Bank of England.", "This in turn led to investor panic and a bank run in mid-September 2007.", "Calls by Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored; in February 2008, however, the British government (having failed to find a private sector buyer) relented, and the bank was taken into public hands.", "Northern Rock's problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions.", "IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower\u2019s income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories.", "Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well.", "As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac\u2019s business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower\u2019s needs, using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products.", "Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments.", "The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market.", "IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.", "Typical American families did not fare as well, nor did those \"wealthy-but-not wealthiest\" families just beneath the pyramid's top.", "On the other hand, half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis.", "The Federal Reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009, and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all Americans declined in that period. 77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth, while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease.", "On November 3, 2008, the European Commission at Brussels predicted for 2009 an extremely weak growth of GDP, by 0.1%, for the countries of the Eurozone (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium etc.) and even negative number for the UK (\u22121.0%), Ireland and Spain.", "On November 6, the IMF at Washington, D.C., launched numbers predicting a worldwide recession by \u22120.3% for 2009, averaged over the developed economies.", "On the same day, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, respectively, reduced their interest rates from 4.5% down to 3%, and from 3.75% down to 3.25%.", "As a consequence, starting from November 2008, several countries launched large \"help packages\" for their economies.", "The U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks around the world have taken steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral, in which lower wages and higher unemployment lead to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption.", "In addition, governments have enacted large fiscal stimulus packages, by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis.", "The U.S. Federal Reserve's new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma, broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity, and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity.", "This credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse.", "The response of the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks was immediate and dramatic.", "During the last quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks.", "This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history.", "Following a model initiated by the United Kingdom bank rescue package, the governments of European nations and the USA guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks.", "In October 2010, Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the U.S. Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy \u2014creating currency\u2014 as a method to combat the liquidity trap.", "By creating $600 billion and inserting[clarification needed] this directly into banks, the Federal Reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages.", "However, banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets.", "Banks were also investing in foreign currencies, which Stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while China redirects its currency holdings away from the United States.", "United States President Barack Obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009.", "The proposals address consumer protection, executive pay, bank financial cushions or capital requirements, expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives, and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions, among others.", "In January 2010, Obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading.", "The proposals were dubbed \"The Volcker Rule\", in recognition of Paul Volcker, who has publicly argued for the proposed changes.", "The U.S. Senate passed a reform bill in May 2010, following the House which passed a bill in December 2009.", "These bills must now be reconciled.", "The New York Times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills, which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the Obama administration.", "For instance, the Volcker Rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation, though in the Senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades.", "It threatened the collapse of large financial institutions, which was prevented by the bailout of banks by national governments, but stock markets still dropped worldwide.", "In many areas, the housing market also suffered, resulting in evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment.", "The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses, declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars, and a downturn in economic activity leading to the 2008\u20132012 global recession and contributing to the European sovereign-debt crisis.", "The active phase of the crisis, which manifested as a liquidity crisis, can be dated from August 9, 2007, when BNP Paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing \"a complete evaporation of liquidity\".", "The bursting of the U.S. (United States) housing bubble, which peaked in 2004, caused the values of securities tied to U.S. real estate pricing to plummet, damaging financial institutions globally.", "The financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of policies that encouraged home ownership, providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers, overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate, questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers, compensation structures that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation, and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making.", "Questions regarding bank solvency, declines in credit availability and damaged investor confidence had an impact on global stock markets, where securities suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009.", "Economies worldwide slowed during this period, as credit tightened and international trade declined.", "Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus, monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts.", "In the U.S., Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.", "Many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested, with varying weight assigned by experts.", "The U.S. Senate's Levin\u2013Coburn Report concluded that the crisis was the result of \"high risk, complex financial products; undisclosed conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators, the credit rating agencies, and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street.\"", "The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by \"widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision\", \"dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions\", \"a combination of excessive borrowing, risky investments, and lack of transparency\" by financial institutions, ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that \"added to the uncertainty and panic\", a \"systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics\", \"collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline\", deregulation of over-the-counter derivatives, especially credit default swaps, and \"the failures of credit rating agencies\" to correctly price risk.", "The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States.", "Critics argued that credit rating agencies and investors failed to accurately price the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not adjust their regulatory practices to address 21st-century financial markets.", "Research into the causes of the financial crisis has also focused on the role of interest rate spreads.", "As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased.", "Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market.", "As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses.", "Falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan, providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosure.", "The ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the U.S. continues to drain wealth from consumers and erodes the financial strength of banking institutions.", "Defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy.", "Total losses are estimated in the trillions of U.S. dollars globally.", "While the housing and credit bubbles were building, a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile, a process called financialization.", "U.S. Government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business, which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions.", "Thus, policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds, also known as the shadow banking system.", "Some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial (depository) banks in providing credit to the U.S. economy, but they were not subject to the same regulations.", "These institutions, as well as certain regulated banks, had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or MBS losses.", "These losses impacted the ability of financial institutions to lend, slowing economic activity.", "Concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the commercial paper markets, which are integral to funding business operations.", "Governments also bailed out key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs, assuming significant additional financial commitments.", "The U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported its findings in January 2011.", "It concluded that \"the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve\u2019s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels\".", "During a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share, and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited, mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers.", "In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003.", "However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated.", "The worst loans were originated in 2004\u20132007, the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs.", "The majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, written by the six Democratic appointees, the minority report, written by 3 of the 4 Republican appointees, studies by Federal Reserve economists, and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis.", "Although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis, they contend that GSE loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks, and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios.", "Paul Krugman has even claimed that the GSE never purchased subprime loans \u2013 a claim that is widely disputed.", "In his dissent to the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, American Enterprise Institute fellow Peter J. Wallison stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by HUD in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.", "Later, based upon information in the SEC's December 2011 securities fraud case against 6 ex-executives of Fannie and Freddie, Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto estimated that, in 2008, Fannie and Freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over $2 trillion.", "In the early and mid-2000s, the Bush administration called numerous times for investigation into the safety and soundness of the GSEs and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages.", "On September 10, 2003, the House Financial Services Committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities.", "The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation.", "Some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the U.S. financial system that went unheeded.", "A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period.", "The majority of these were prime loans.", "Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998, but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all sub-prime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of sub-prime loans had some connection with CRA.", "In addition, an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas in 2009, however, concluded that the CRA was not responsible for the mortgage loan crisis, pointing out that CRA rules have been in place since 1995 whereas the poor lending emerged only a decade later.", "Furthermore, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA, especially in the years 2005\u20132006 leading up to the crisis.", "Nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.", "To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA.", "They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.", "Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place.", "Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.", "They also argue that the Federal Reserve\u2019s classification of CRA loans as \u201cprime\u201d is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal \u201csubprime\u201d loans.", "Others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude.", "In an article in Portfolio Magazine, Michael Lewis spoke with one trader who noted that \"There weren\u2019t enough Americans with [bad] credit taking out [bad loans] to satisfy investors' appetite for the end product.\"", "Essentially, investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made, far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans, using derivatives called credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and synthetic CDOs.", "Countering Krugman, Peter J. Wallison wrote: \"It is not true that every bubble\u2014even a large bubble\u2014has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates.\"", "Wallison notes that other developed countries had \"large bubbles during the 1997\u20132007 period\" but \"the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997\u20132007 [bubble] deflated.\"", "According to Wallison, the reason the U.S. residential housing bubble (as opposed to other types of bubbles) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans \u2013 generally with low or no downpayments."]}, {"qa": [{"question": "Where were Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen from?", "id":

mountains from an early age; he left a law career to become a naturalist and spent many years trekking through the Bernese Oberland, the Savoy, the Piedmont and Valais, studying the glaciers and the geology, as he became an early proponent of the theory of rock upheaval.", "Saussure, in 1787, was a member of the third ascent of Mont Blanc\u2014today the summits of all the peaks have been

the economy.", "Farming and forestry continue to be mainstays of Alpine culture, industries that provide for export to the cities and maintain the mountain ecology.", "Much of the Alpine culture is unchanged since the medieval period when skills that guaranteed survival in the mountain valleys and in the highest villages became mainstays, leading to strong traditions of carpentry, woodcarving,

traditional manner on carved wooden plates.", "Furniture has been traditionally elaborately carved and in many Alpine countries carpentry skills are passed from generation to generation.", "Roofs are traditionally constructed from Alpine rocks such as pieces of schist, gneiss or slate.", "Such chalets are typically found in the higher parts of the valleys, as in the Maurienne valley in Savoy,

perhaps Etruscan.", "At present the Alps are one of the more popular tourist destinations in the world with many resorts such Oberstdorf, in Bavaria, Saalbach in Austria, Davos in Switzerland, Chamonix in France, and Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy recording more than a million annual visitors.", "With over 120 million visitors a year tourism is integral to the Alpine economy with much it coming from winter sports although summer visitors are an important component of the tourism industry.", "The tourism industry began in the early 19th century when foreigners visited the Alps, traveled to the bases of the mountains to enjoy the scenery, and stayed at the spa-resorts.", "Large hotels were built during the Belle \u00c9poque; cog-railways, built early in the 20th century, brought tourists to ever higher elevations, with the Jungfraubahn terminating at the Jungfraujoch, well above the eternal snow-line, after going through a tunnel in Eiger.", "During this period winter sports were slowly introduced: in 1882 the first figure skating championship was held in St. Moritz, and downhill skiing became a popular sport with English visitors early in the 20th century, as the first ski-lift was installed in 1908 above Grindelwald.", "In the first half of the 20th century the Olympic Winter Games were held three times in Alpine venues: the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix,

the Lauberhorn Rennen (Lauberhorn Race), was run for the first time on the Lauberhorn above Wengen; the equally demanding Hahnenkamm was first run in the same year in Kitzb\u00fchl, Austria.", "Both races continue to be held each January on successive weekends.", "The Lauberhorn is the more strenuous downhill race at 4.5 km (2.8 mi) and poses danger to racers who reach 130 km/h (81 mph) within seconds of leaving the start gate.", "During the post-World War I period ski-lifts were built in Swiss and Austrian towns to accommodate winter visitors, but summer tourism continued to be important; by the mid-20th century the popularity of downhill skiing increased greatly as it became more accessible and in the 1970s several new villages were built in France devoted almost exclusively to skiing, such as Les Menuires.", "Until this point Austria and Switzerland had been the traditional and more popular destinations for winter sports, but by the end of the 20th century and into the early 21st century, France, Italy and the Tyrol began to see increases in winter visitors.", "From 1980 to the present, ski-lifts have been modernized and snow-making machines installed at many resorts, leading to concerns regarding the loss of traditional Alpine culture and questions regarding sustainable development as the winter ski industry continues to develop quickly and the number of summer tourists decline.", "The region is serviced by 4,200 km (2,600 mi) of roads used by 6 million vehicles.", "Train travel is well established in the Alps, with, for instance 120 km (75 mi) of track for every 1,000 km2 (390 sq mi) in a country such as Switzerland.", "Most of Europe's highest railways are located there.", "Moreover, plans are underway to build a 57 km (35 mi)-long sub-alpine tunnel connecting the older L\u00f6tschberg and Gotthard tunnels built in the 19th century.", "Some high mountain villages, such as Avoriaz (in France), Wengen, and Zermatt (in Switzerland) are accessible only by cable car or cog-rail trains, and are car free.", "Other villages in the Alps are considering becoming car free zones or limiting the number of cars for reasons of sustainability of the fragile Alpine terrain.", "The lower regions and larger towns of the Alps are well-served by motorways and main roads, but higher mountain passes and byroads, which are amongst the highest in Europe, can be treacherous even in summer due to steep slopes.", "Many passes are closed in winter.", "A multitude of airports around the Alps (and some within), as well as long-distance rail links from all neighbouring countries, afford large numbers of travellers easy access from abroad."]}, {"qa": [{"question": "What was Zhejiang formerly romanized as?", "id": 4745}, {"question": "Which

"Prominent Reformed charismatic denominations are the Sovereign Grace Churches and the Every Nation Churches in the USA, in Great Britain there is the Newfrontiers churches and movement, which leading figure is Terry Virgo.", "Puritans were blocked from changing the established church from within, and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling the practice of religion.", "Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands (and later to New England), and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later into Wales), and were spread into lay society and parts of the educational system, particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge.", "They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the Synod of Dort they were resisted by the English bishops.", "They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century, and were influenced by millennialism.", "They formed, and identified with various religious groups advocating greater purity of worship and doctrine, as well as personal and group piety.", "Puritans adopted a Reformed theology, but they also took note of radical criticisms of Zwingli in Zurich and Calvin in Geneva.", "In church polity, some advocated for separation from all other Christians, in favor of autonomous gathered churches.", "These separatist and independent strands of Puritanism became prominent in the 1640s, when the supporters of a Presbyterian polity in the Westminster Assembly were unable to forge a new English national church.", "Although the Reformation was a religious movement, it also had a strong impact on all other aspects of life: marriage and family, education, the humanities and sciences, the political and social order, the economy, and the arts.", "Protestant churches reject the idea of a celibate priesthood and thus allow their clergy to marry.", "Many of their families contributed to the development of intellectual elites in their countries.", "Since about 1950, women have entered the ministry, and some have assumed leading positions (e.g. bishops), in most Protestant churches.", "As the Reformers wanted all members of the church to be able to read the Bible, education on all levels got a strong boost.", "By the middle of the eighteenth century, the literacy rate in England was about 60 per cent, in Scotland 65 per cent, and in Sweden eight of ten men and women were able to read and to write.", "Colleges and universities were founded.", "For example, the Puritans who established Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1628 founded Harvard College only eight years later.", "About a dozen other colleges followed in the 18th century, including Yale (1701).", "Pennsylvania also became a centre of learning.", "The Protestant concept of God and man allows believers to use all their God-given faculties, including the power of reason.", "That means that they are allowed to explore God's creation and, according to Genesis 2:15, make use of it in a responsible and sustainable way.", "Thus a cultural climate was created that greatly enhanced the development of the humanities and the sciences.", "Another consequence of the Protestant understanding of man is that the believers, in gratitude for their election and redemption in Christ, are to follow God's commandments.", "Industry, frugality, calling, discipline, and a strong sense of responsibility are at the heart of their moral code.", "In particular, Calvin rejected luxury.", "Therefore, craftsmen, industrialists, and other businessmen were able to reinvest the greater part of their profits in the most efficient machinery and the most modern production methods that were based on progress in the sciences and technology.", "As a result, productivity grew, which led to increased profits and enabled employers to pay higher wages.", "In this way, the economy, the sciences, and technology reinforced each other.", "The chance to participate in the economic success of technological inventions was a strong incentive to both inventors and investors.", "The Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated mass action that influenced the development of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution.", "This idea is also known as the \"Protestant ethic thesis.\"", "In a factor analysis of the latest wave of World Values Survey data, Arno Tausch (Corvinus University of Budapest) found that Protestantism emerges to be very close to combining religion and the traditions of liberalism.", "The Global Value Development Index, calculated by Tausch, relies on the World Values Survey dimensions such as trust in the state of law, no support for shadow economy, postmaterial activism, support for democracy, a non-acceptance of violence, xenophobia and racism, trust in transnational capital and Universities, confidence in the market economy, supporting gender justice, and engaging in environmental activism, etc.", "Episcopalians and Presbyterians, as well as other WASPs, tend to be considerably wealthier and better educated (having graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita) than most other religious groups in United States, and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law and politics, especially the Republican Party.", "Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families as the Vanderbilts and the Astors, Rockefeller, Du Pont, Roosevelt, Forbes, Whitneys, the Morgans and Harrimans are Mainline Protestant families.", "Protestantism has had an important influence on science.", "According to the Merton Thesis, there was a positive correlation between the rise of English Puritanism and German Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other.", "The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values.", "Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries.", "He explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science.", "Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God's influence on the world\u2014his creation\u2014and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.", "In the Middle Ages, the Church and the worldly authorities were closely related.", "Martin Luther separated the religious and the worldly realms in principle (doctrine of the two kingdoms).", "The believers were obliged to use reason to govern the worldly sphere in an orderly and peaceful way.", "Luther's doctrine of the priesthood of all believers upgraded the role of laymen in the church considerably.", "The members of a congregation had the right to elect a minister and, if necessary, to vote for his dismissal (Treatise On the right and authority of a Christian assembly or congregation to judge all doctrines and to call, install and dismiss teachers, as testified in Scripture; 1523).", "Calvin strengthened this basically democratic approach by including elected laymen (church elders, presbyters) in his representative church government.", "The Huguenots added regional synods and a national synod, whose members were elected by the congregations, to Calvin's system of church self-government.", "This system was taken over by the other reformed churches.", "Politically, Calvin favoured a mixture of aristocracy and democracy.", "He appreciated the advantages of democracy: \"It is an invaluable gift, if God allows a people to freely elect its own authorities and overlords.\"", "Calvin also thought that earthly rulers lose their divine right and must be put down when they rise up against God.", "To further protect the rights of ordinary people, Calvin suggested separating political powers in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers).", "Thus he and his followers resisted political absolutism and paved the way for the rise of modern democracy.", "Besides England, the Netherlands were, under Calvinist leadership, the freest country in Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.", "It granted asylum to philosophers like Baruch Spinoza and Pierre Bayle.", "Hugo Grotius was able to teach his natural-law theory and a relatively liberal interpretation of the Bible.", "Consistent with Calvin's political ideas, Protestants created both the English and the American democracies.", "In seventeenth-century England, the most important persons and events in this process were the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell, John Milton, John Locke, the Glorious Revolution, the English Bill of Rights, and the Act of Settlement.", "Later, the British took their democratic ideals to their colonies, e.g. Australia, New Zealand, and India.", "In North America, Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers; 1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) practised democratic self-rule and separation of powers.", "These Congregationalists were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God.", "The Mayflower Compact was a social contract.", "Protestants also took the initiative in advocating for religious freedom.", "Freedom of conscience had high priority on the theological, philosophical, and political agendas since Luther refused to recant his beliefs before the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire at Worms (1521).", "In his view, faith was a free work of the Holy Spirit and could, therefore, not be forced on a person.", "The persecuted Anabaptists and Huguenots demanded freedom of conscience, and they practised separation of church and state.", "In the early seventeenth century, Baptists like John Smyth and Thomas Helwys published tracts in defense of religious freedom.", "Their thinking influenced John Milton and John Locke's stance on tolerance.", "Under the leadership of Baptist Roger Williams, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker, and Quaker William Penn, respectively, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania combined democratic constitutions with freedom of religion.", "These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.", "The United States Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the American Bill of Rights with its fundamental human rights made this tradition permanent by giving it a legal and political framework.", "The great majority of American Protestants, both clergy and laity, strongly supported the independence movement.", "All major Protestant churches were represented in the First and Second Continental Congresses.", "In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the American democracy became a model for numerous other countries and regions throughout the world (e.g., Latin America, Japan, and Germany).", "The strongest link between the American and French Revolutions was Marquis de Lafayette, an ardent supporter of the American constitutional principles.", "The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was mainly based on Lafayette's draft of this document.", "The United Nations Declaration and Universal Declaration of Human Rights also echo the American constitutional tradition.", "Democracy, social-contract theory, separation of powers, religious freedom, separation of church and state \u2013 these achievements of the Reformation and early Protestantism were elaborated on and popularized by Enlightenment thinkers.", "Some of the philosophers of the English, Scottish, German, and Swiss Enlightenment - Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, John Toland, David Hume, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Christian Wolff, Immanuel Kant, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau - had Protestant backgrounds.", "For example, John Locke, whose political thought was based on \"a set of Protestant Christian assumptions\", derived the equality of all humans, including the equality of the genders (\"Adam and Eve\"), from Genesis 1, 26-28.", "As all persons were created equally free, all governments needed \"the consent of the governed.\"", "These Lockean ideas were fundamental to the United States Declaration of Independence, which also deduced human rights from the biblical belief in creation: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\"", "Also, other human rights were advocated for by some Protestants.", "For example, torture was abolished in Prussia in 1740, slavery in Britain in 1834 and in the United States in 1865 (William Wilberforce, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Abraham Lincoln - against Southern Protestants).", "Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf were among the first thinkers who made significant contributions to international law.", "The Geneva Convention, an important part of humanitarian international law, was largely the work of Henry Dunant, a reformed pietist.", "He also founded the Red Cross.", "Protestants have founded hospitals, homes for disabled or elderly people, educational institutions, organizations that give aid to developing countries, and other social welfare agencies.", "In the nineteenth century, throughout the Anglo-American world, numerous dedicated members of all Protestant denominations were active in social reform movements such as the abolition of slavery, prison reforms, and woman suffrage.", "As an answer to the \"social question\" of the nineteenth century, Germany under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced insurance programs that led the way to the welfare state (health insurance, accident insurance, disability insurance, old-age pensions).", "To Bismarck this was \"practical Christianity\".", "These programs, too, were copied by many other nations, particularly in the Western world.", "World literature was enriched by the works of Edmund Spenser, John Milton, John Bunyan, John Donne, John Dryden, Daniel Defoe, William Wordsworth, Jonathan Swift, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edgar Allan Poe, Matthew Arnold, Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, Theodor Fontane, Washington Irving, Robert Browning, Emily Dickinson, Emily Bront\u00eb, Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Thomas Stearns Eliot, John Galsworthy, Thomas Mann, William Faulkner, John Updike, and many others.", "The view of the Roman Catholic Church is that Protestant denominations cannot be considered churches but rather that they are ecclesial communities or specific faith-believing communities because their ordinances and doctrines are not historically the same as the Catholic sacraments and dogmas, and the Protestant communities have no sacramental ministerial priesthood and therefore lack true apostolic succession.", "According to Bishop Hilarion (Alfeyev) the Eastern Orthodox Church shares the same view on the subject.", "Contrary to how the Protestant Reformers were often characterized, the concept of a catholic or universal Church was not brushed aside during the Protestant Reformation.", "On the contrary, the visible unity of the catholic or universal church was seen by the Protestant reformers as an important and essential doctrine of the Reformation.", "The Magisterial reformers, such as Martin Luther, John Calvin, and Huldrych Zwingli, believed that they were reforming the Roman Catholic Church, which they viewed as having become corrupted.", "Each of them took very seriously the charges of schism and innovation, denying these charges and maintaining that it was the Roman Catholic Church that had left them.", "In order to justify their departure from the Roman Catholic Church, Protestants often posited a new argument, saying that there was no real visible Church with divine authority, only a spiritual, invisible, and hidden church\u2014this notion began in the early days of the Protestant Reformation.", "Wherever the Magisterial Reformation, which received support from the ruling authorities, took place, the result was a reformed national Protestant church envisioned to be a part of the whole invisible church, but disagreeing, in certain important points of doctrine and doctrine-linked practice, with what had until then been considered the normative reference point on such matters, namely the Papacy and central authority of the Roman Catholic Church.", "The Reformed churches thus believed in some form of Catholicity, founded on their doctrines of the five solas and a visible ecclesiastical organization based on the 14th and 15th century Conciliar movement, rejecting the papacy and papal infallibility in favor of ecumenical councils, but rejecting the latest ecumenical council, the Council of Trent.", "Religious unity therefore became not one of doctrine and identity but one of invisible character, wherein the unity was one of faith in Jesus Christ, not common identity, doctrine, belief, and collaborative action.", "The ecumenical movement has had an influence on mainline churches, beginning at least in 1910 with the Edinburgh Missionary Conference.", "Its origins lay in the recognition of the need for cooperation on the mission field in Africa, Asia and Oceania.", "Since 1948, the World Council of Churches has been influential, but ineffective in creating a united church.", "There are also ecumenical bodies at regional, national and local levels across the globe; but schisms still far outnumber unifications.", "One, but not the only expression of the ecumenical movement, has been the move to form united churches, such as the Church of South India, the Church of North India, the US-based United Church of Christ, the United Church of Canada, the Uniting Church in Australia and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which have rapidly declining memberships.", "There has been a strong engagement of Orthodox churches in the ecumenical movement, though the reaction of individual Orthodox theologians has ranged from tentative approval of the aim of Christian unity to outright condemnation of the perceived effect of watering down Orthodox doctrine.", "A Protestant baptism is held to be valid by the Catholic Church if given with the trinitarian formula and with the intent to baptize.", "However, as the ordination of Protestant ministers is not recognized due to the lack of apostolic succession and the disunity from Catholic Church, all other sacraments (except marriage) performed by Protestant denominations and ministers are not recognized as valid.", "Therefore, Protestants desiring full communion with the Catholic Church are not re-baptized (although they are confirmed) and Protestant ministers who become Catholics may be ordained to the priesthood after a period of study.", "In 1999, the representatives of Lutheran World Federation and Catholic Church signed the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, apparently resolving the conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation, although Confessional Lutherans reject this statement.", "This is understandable, since there is no compelling authority within them.", "On 18 July 2006, delegates to the World Methodist Conference voted unanimously to adopt the Joint Declaration.", "There are more than 900 million Protestants worldwide,[ad] among approximately 2.4 billion Christians.", "[ae] In 2010, a total of more than 800 million included 300 million in Sub-Saharan Africa, 260 million in the Americas, 140 million in Asia-Pacific region, 100 million in Europe and 2 million in Middle East-North Africa.", "Protestants account for nearly forty percent of Christians worldwide and more than one tenth of the total human population.", "Various estimates put the percentage of Protestants in relation to the total number of world's Christians at 33%, 36%, 36.7%, and 40%, while in relation to the world's population at 11.6% and 13%.", "In European countries which were most profoundly influenced by the Reformation, Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion.", "These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom.", "In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary, it remains one of the most popular religions.", "Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, there are only few Protestant adherents; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, restrictions during the Communist rule, and also the ongoing secularization.", "Over the last several decades, religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased.", "According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Protestants made up 12% of the EU population.", "According to Pew Research Center, Protestants constituted nearly one fifth (or 17.8%) of the continent's Christian population in 2010.", "Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15% of all Europeans in 2009, while Noll claims that less than 12% of them lived in Europe in 2010.", "Changes in worldwide Protestantism over the last century have been significant.", "Since 1900, Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America.", "That caused Protestantism to be called a primarily non-Western religion.", "Much of the growth has occurred after World War II, when decolonization of Africa and abolition of various restrictions against Protestants in Latin American countries occurred.", "According to one source, Protestants constituted respectively 2.5%, 2%, 0.5% of Latin Americans, Africans and Asians.", "In 2000, percentage of Protestants on mentioned continents was 17%, more than 27% and 5.5%, respectively.", "According to Mark A. Noll, 79% of Anglicans lived in the United Kingdom in 1910, while most of the remainder was found in the United States and across the British Commonwealth.", "By 2010, 59% of Anglicans were found in Africa.", "In 2010, more Protestants lived in India than in the UK or Germany, while Protestants in Brazil accounted for as many people as Protestants in the UK and Germany combined.", "Almost as many lived in each of Nigeria and China as in all of Europe.", "China is home to world's largest Protestant minority.", "[af]"]}, {"qa": [{"question": "What kind of government does Armenia have?", "id":

ability to fly and became primarily aquatic.", "The early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds, like strongly keeled breastbones, toothless, beaked portions of their jaws (though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws).", "Euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers, which may have replaced the \"hind wing\" as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight.", "All modern birds lie within the crown group Aves (alternately Neornithes),

possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, but the dates for the actual splits are much debated by scientists.", "The Aves are agreed to have evolved in the Cretaceous, and the split between the Galloanseri from other Neognathes occurred before the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, but there are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining Neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs.", "This disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence; molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation, while fossil evidence supports a Cenozoic radiation.", "Attempts to reconcile the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial, but recent results show that all the extant groups of birds originated from only a small handful of species that survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction.", "The classification of birds is a contentious issue.", "Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark work on the classification of birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised.", "Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged.", "More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.", "The most recent

extreme in the snow petrel's breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in Antarctica.", "The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions.", "It was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics, however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics.", "Several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them, with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft).", "Many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans.", "Some of these introductions have been deliberate; the ring-necked pheasant, for example, has been introduced around the world as a game bird.", "Others have been accidental, such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several North American cities after their escape from captivity.", "Some species, including cattle egret, yellow-headed caracara and galah, have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat.", "The skeleton consists of very lightweight bones.", "They have large air-filled cavities (called pneumatic cavities) which connect with the respiratory system.", "The skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures.", "The orbits are large and separated by a bony septum.", "The spine has cervical, thoracic, lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical (neck) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible, but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae.", "The last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum.", "The ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders.", "The forelimbs are modified into wings.", "Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine.", "Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste.", "However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia.", "They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals.", "This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca.", "The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it.", "In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets.", "Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves.", "The length is thought to be related to sperm competition.", "When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent.", "The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth.", "Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight.", "Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.", "Birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups.", "Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air.", "The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs.", "When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lung and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs.", "Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation.", "Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalizations and the perception of the bird's size.", "The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac.", "This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication.", "The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle.", "The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction.", "Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium.", "The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles.", "The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers.", "Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers.", "The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body.", "Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass.", "This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight.", "Birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals.", "As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal.", "The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart.", "Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo vasoconstriction, and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body.", "As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow.", "Travelling through the arterioles blood moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur.", "Capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues, it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste.", "In the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues.", "Once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart.", "Veins, unlike arteries, are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure.", "As blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart.", "Once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium, then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen.", "Oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body.", "The nervous system is large relative to the bird's size.", "The most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions, while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns, navigation, mating and nest building.", "Most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis, New World vultures and tubenoses.", "The avian visual system is usually highly developed.", "Water birds have special flexible lenses, allowing accommodation for vision in air and water.", "Some species also have dual fovea.", "Birds are tetrachromatic, possessing ultraviolet (UV) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green, red and blue ones.", "This allows them to perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in courtship.", "Birds have specialized light-sensing cells deep in their brains that respond to light without input from eyes or other sensory neurons.", "These photo-receptive cells in the hypothalamus are involved in detecting the longer days of spring, and thus regulate breeding activities.", "Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers.", "Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers.", "Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging\u2014kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents.", "The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking.", "Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally.", "The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds.", "The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.", "Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant.", "Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field.", "The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears.", "The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.", "A dearth of field observations limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death.", "The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon.", "The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents.", "The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius.", "The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail.", "Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.", "Feathers are a feature characteristic of birds (though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds).", "They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signaling.", "There are several types of feathers, each serving its own set of purposes.", "Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae.", "The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics.", "The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.", "Plumage is regularly moulted; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \"non-breeding\" plumage, or\u2014in the Humphrey-Parkes terminology\u2014\"basic\" plumage; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey-Parkes system as \"alternate\" plumages.", "Moulting is annual in most species, although some may have two moults a year, and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years.", "Moulting patterns vary across species.", "In passerines, flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first.", "When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced, the outermost tertiaries begin to drop.", "After the innermost tertiaries are moulted, the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers (centrifugal moult).", "The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap.", "A small number of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight feathers at once, temporarily becoming flightless.", "As a general rule, the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair.", "Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae.", "The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail.", "The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from center outward.", "Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly.", "The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.", "Feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily, spending an average of around 9% of their daily time on this.", "The bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland; these secretions protect the feathers' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent, inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria.", "This may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants, which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting, to remove feather parasites.", "Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes.", "Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape.", "Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.", "Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight.", "About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds.", "Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators.", "Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \"fly\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.", "Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists.", "Birds' feeding strategies vary by species.", "Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds.", "Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch.", "Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs.", "Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers.", "Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches.", "Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey.", "Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders.", "Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.", "Some species, including frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, engage in kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds.", "Kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%.", "Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.", "Most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat.", "Some species, especially of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads.", "Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes.", "Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers.", "Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food.", "The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.", "Feathers being critical to the survival of a bird, require maintenance.", "Apart from physical wear and tear, feathers face the onslaught of fungi, ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice.", "The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland.", "Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves.", "While some birds dip into shallow water, more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves.", "Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe.", "A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers.", "Many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage.", "Many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat.", "These migrations vary among the different groups.", "Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions.", "These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere.", "Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.", "Migration is highly demanding energetically, particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling.", "Landbirds have a flight range of around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) and shorebirds can fly up to 4,000 km (2,500 mi), although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi).", "Seabirds also undertake long migrations, the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters, which nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of 64,000 km (39,800 mi).", "Other seabirds disperse after breeding, travelling widely but having no set migration route.", "Albatrosses nesting in the Southern Ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons.", "Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food.", "Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next.", "This type of migration is normally associated with food availability.", "Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates.", "Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory.", "Altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions.", "It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food.", "Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability.", "Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.", "The ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s a Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales, within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 km (3,200 mi).", "Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods.", "For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night.", "Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock.", "Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris.", "These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.", "Birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance, to display breeding condition in sexually selected species, or to make threatening displays, as in the sunbittern's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks.", "Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species.", "Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour.", "These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds.", "The most elaborate displays occur during courtship, where \"dances\" are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements; males' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays.", "Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat.", "Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication.", "The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.", "While some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks.", "The principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency.", "Defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system.", "This has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources.", "Costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.", "The high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times.", "Sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep, where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening \"peeks\", allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats.", "Swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight.", "It has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight.", "Some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time.", "The birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock.", "This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock.", "This adaptation is also known from marine mammals.", "Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators.", "Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.", "Many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers.", "Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather.", "Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep.", "Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees.", "A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down.", "Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates.", "This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows.", "One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation.", "Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.", "Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous.", "These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or\u2014in some cases\u2014for several years or until the death of one mate.", "Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing.", "Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common.", "Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.", "Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species.", "Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism.", "For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate.", "Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.", "Breeding usually involves some form of courtship display, typically performed by the male.", "Most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song.", "Some displays, however, are quite elaborate.", "Depending on the species, these may include wing or tail drumming, dancing, aerial flights, or communal lekking.", "Females are generally the ones that drive partner selection, although in the polyandrous phalaropes, this is reversed: plainer males choose brightly coloured females.", "Courtship feeding, billing and allopreening are commonly performed between partners, generally after the birds have paired and mated.", "All birds lay amniotic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate.", "Hole and burrow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs, while open nesters lay camouflaged eggs.", "There are many exceptions to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage.", "Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.", "Bird eggs are usually laid in a nest.", "Most species create somewhat elaborate nests, which can be cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows.", "Some bird nests, however, are extremely primitive; albatross nests are no more than a scrape on the ground.", "Most birds build nests in sheltered, hidden areas to avoid predation, but large or colonial birds\u2014which are more capable of defence\u2014may build more open nests.", "During nest construction, some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite-reducing toxins to improve chick survival, and feathers are often used for nest insulation.", "Some bird species have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet.", "The absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground-nesting species where the newly hatched young are precocial.", "Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid.", "In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation.", "Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds.", "Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation.", "The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.", "Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).", "The length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species.", "At one extreme, parental care in megapodes ends at hatching; the newly hatched chick digs itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fend for itself immediately.", "At the other extreme, many seabirds have extended periods of parental care, the longest being that of the great frigatebird, whose chicks take up to six months to fledge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months.", "The chick guard stage describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatched.", "The main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to thermoregulate and protect them from predation.", "In some species, both parents care for nestlings and fledglings; in others, such care is the responsibility of only one sex.", "In some species, other members of the same species\u2014usually close relatives of the breeding pair, such as offspring from previous broods\u2014will help with the raising of the young.", "Such alloparenting is particularly common among the Corvida, which includes such birds as the true crows, Australian magpie and fairy-wrens, but has been observed in species as different as the rifleman and red kite.", "Among most groups of animals, male parental care is rare.", "In birds, however, it is quite common\u2014more so than in any other vertebrate class.", "Though territory and nest site defence, incubation, and chick feeding are often shared tasks, there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertakes all or most of a particular duty.", "The point at which chicks fledge varies dramatically.", "The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, following their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators.", "Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age.", "In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, they are able to fly.", "The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging.", "Chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration.", "Brood parasitism, in which an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than any other type of organism.", "After a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host's own brood.", "Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young.", "One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos.", "Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.", "Birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviors, with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the Fisherian runaway.", "Commonly occurring sexual dimorphisms such as size and color differences are energetically costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations.", "Many types of avian sexual selection have been identified; intersexual selection, also known as female choice; and intrasexual competition, where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate.", "Sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual\u2019s fitness.", "Conflicts between an individual fitness and signaling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behavior are \"honest\" traits.", "Signals must be costly to ensure that only good-quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviors.", "Incestuous matings by the purple-crowned fairy wren Malurus coronatus result in severe fitness costs due to inbreeding depression (greater than 30% reduction in hatchability of eggs).", "Females paired with related males may undertake extra pair matings (see Promiscuity#Other animals for 90% frequency in avian species) that can reduce the negative effects of inbreeding.", "However, there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair matings.", "Nevertheless, 43% of broods produced by incestuously paired females contained extra pair young.", "Cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring, usually males, delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin.", "Female offspring rarely stay at home, dispersing over distances that allow them to breed independently, or to join unrelated groups.", "In general, inbreeding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in progeny fitness (inbreeding depression) due largely to the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive alleles.", "Cross-fertilization between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive alleles in progeny.", "Birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions.", "While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements.", "Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor.", "Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores.", "Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism.", "Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers.", "Avivores are animals that are specialized at preying on birds.", "Birds are often important to island ecology.", "Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals.", "For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, as are the kereru and kokako today.", "Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.", "Nesting seabirds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.", "Since birds are highly visible and common animals, humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man.", "Sometimes, these relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana.", "Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities.", "Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard.", "Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).", "Domesticated birds raised for meat and eggs, called poultry, are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans; in 2003, 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide.", "Chickens account for much of human poultry consumption, though domesticated turkeys, ducks, and geese are also relatively common.", "Many species of birds are also hunted for meat.", "Bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas.", "The most important birds hunted in North and South America are waterfowl; other widely hunted birds include pheasants, wild turkeys, quail, doves, partridge, grouse, snipe, and woodcock.", "Muttonbirding is also popular in Australia and New Zealand.", "Though some hunting, such as that of muttonbirds, may be sustainable, hunting has led to the extinction or endangerment of dozens of species.", "Birds have been domesticated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes.", "Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species.", "Falcons and cormorants have long been used for hunting and fishing, respectively.", "Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II.", "Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.", "Birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology.", "In religion, birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity, such as in the Cult of Makemake, in which the Tangata manu of Easter Island served as chiefs or as attendants, as in the case of Hugin and Munin, the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the Norse god Odin.", "In several civilizations of ancient Italy, particularly Etruscan and Roman religion, priests were involved in augury, or interpreting the words of birds while the \"auspex\" (from which the word \"auspicious\" is derived) watched their activities to foretell events.", "They may also serve as religious symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves.", "Birds have themselves been deified, as in the case of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India.", "In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms.", "Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.", "The mythical chullumpi bird is said to mark the existence of a portal between such worlds, and to transform itself into a llama.", "Birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times, when they were represented in early cave paintings.", "Some birds have been perceived as monsters, including the mythological Roc and the M\u0101ori's legendary Pou\u0101kai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans.", "Birds were later used as symbols of power, as in the magnificent Peacock Throne of the Mughal and Persian emperors.", "With the advent of scientific interest in birds, many paintings of birds were commissioned for books.", "Among the most famous of these bird artists was John James Audubon, whose paintings of North American birds were a great commercial success in Europe and who later lent his name to the National Audubon Society.", "Birds are also important figures in poetry; for example, Homer incorporated nightingales into his Odyssey, and Catullus used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his Catullus 2.", "The relationship between an albatross and a sailor is the central theme of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a 'burden'.", "Other English metaphors derive from birds; vulture funds and vulture investors, for instance, take their name from the scavenging vulture.", "Though human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species, such as the barn swallow and European starling, they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species.", "Over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused avian extinctions, eradicating an estimated 750\u20131800 species, occurred during the human colonisation of Melanesian, Polynesian, and Micronesian islands.", "Many bird populations are declining worldwide, with 1,227

caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.", "[citation needed]", "Diarrheal disease may have a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental development.", "\"Early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults,\" and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition.", "Further, evidence suggests that diarrheal disease has significant impacts on mental development and health; it has been shown that, even when controlling for helminth infection and early breastfeeding, children who had experienced severe diarrhea had significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence.", "Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool (diarrhea or constipation) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months.", "Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements, and/or medications such as loperamide or codeine.", "About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have bile acid malabsorption diagnosed with an abnormal SeHCAT test.", "Poverty is a good indicator of the rate of infectious diarrhea in a population.", "This association does not stem from poverty itself, but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live.", "The absence of certain resources compromises the ability of the poor to defend themselves against infectious diarrhea.", "\"Poverty is associated with poor housing, crowding, dirt floors, lack of access to clean water or to sanitary disposal of fecal waste (sanitation), cohabitation with domestic animals that may carry human pathogens, and a lack of refrigerated storage for food, all of which increase the frequency of diarrhea...", "Poverty also restricts the ability to provide age-appropriate, nutritionally balanced diets or to modify diets when diarrhea develops so as to mitigate and repair nutrient losses.", "The impact is exacerbated by the lack of adequate, available, and affordable medical care.\"", "Proper nutrition is important for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea.", "It is especially important to young children who do not have a fully developed immune system.", "Zinc deficiency, a condition often found in children in developing countries can, even in mild cases, have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system.", "Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea.", "Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever.", "Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes, however there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease.", "While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency.", "Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.", "According to two researchers, Nesse and Williams, diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism.", "As a result, if it is stopped, there might be a delay in recovery.", "They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating Shigella with the anti-diarrhea drug (Co-phenotrope, Lomotil) caused people to stay feverish twice as long as those not so treated.", "The researchers indeed themselves observed that: \"Lomotil may be contraindicated in shigellosis.", "Diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism\".", "Basic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of diarrheal disease.", "The implementation of hand washing using soap and water, for example, has been experimentally shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately 42\u201348%.", "Hand washing in developing countries, however, is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the CDC: \"Handwashing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world; however, access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries.", "This lack of access is one of many challenges to proper hygiene in less developed countries.\"", "Solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours.", "Given that water contamination is a major means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation have the potential to dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence.", "In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene.", "Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22\u201327% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21\u201330% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.", "Immunization against the pathogens that cause diarrheal disease is a viable prevention strategy, however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination.", "In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%.", "Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease.", "Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that have the potential to save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.", "Dietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices.", "Supplementation with vitamin A and/or zinc.", "Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group.", "The majority of the literature suggests that vitamin A supplementation is advantageous in reducing disease incidence.", "Development of a supplementation strategy should take into consideration the fact that vitamin A supplementation was less effective in reducing diarrhea incidence when compared to vitamin A and zinc supplementation, and that the latter strategy was estimated to be significantly more cost effective.", "In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed.", "This is usually by mouth \u2013 oral rehydration therapy \u2013 or, in severe cases, intravenously.", "Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended.", "Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea.", "To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning.", "CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat.", "Oral rehydration solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened and salty water) can be used to prevent dehydration.", "Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given.", "Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter.", "Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given.", "There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar.", "A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the \"taste of tears\").", "Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness.", "Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.", "Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration.", "A too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water.", "Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable.", "Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall.", "A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.", "WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed.", "Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function.", "In contrast, children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly.", "A child should also continue to be breastfed.", "The WHO states \"Food should never be withheld and the child's usual foods should not be diluted.", "Breastfeeding should always be continued.\"", "And in the specific example of cholera, CDC also makes the same recommendation.", "In young children who are not breast-fed and live in the developed world, a lactose-free diet may be useful to speed recovery.", "While antibiotics are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea, they are usually not used except in specific situations.", "There are concerns that antibiotics may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome in people infected with Escherichia coli O157:H7.", "In resource-poor countries, treatment with antibiotics may be beneficial.", "However, some bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance, particularly Shigella.", "Antibiotics can also cause diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is the most common adverse effect of treatment with general antibiotics."]}, {"qa": [{"question": "What is the aggregate
