planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe.", "Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus.", "The onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700 nm and 800 nm, but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined.", "The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700 nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources.", "However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780 nm, and will be perceived as red light.", "Sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050 nm can be seen as a dull red glow in intense sources, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination).", "Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of IR-glowing foliage.", "The concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects.", "This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body.", "To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity.", "For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler.", "For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.", "Infrared vibrational spectroscopy (see also near-infrared spectroscopy) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds.", "Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond.", "A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole.", "If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule

photography, infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum.", "Digital cameras often use infrared blockers.", "Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can \"see\" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color.", "This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image.", "There is also a technique called 'T-ray' imaging, which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation.", "Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques.", "Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.", "Infrared reflectography (fr; it; es), as called by art conservators, can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive

radiation\"[citation needed], but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them.", "Infrared light from the Sun accounts for 49% of the heating of Earth, with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths.", "Visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation.", "Objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25 \u00b5m band, but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects (see black body and Wien's displacement law).", "Infrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a passive missile guidance system, which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it.", "Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as \"heat-seekers\", since

and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.", "High, cold ice clouds such as Cirrus or Cumulonimbus show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as Stratus or Stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly.", "Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black.", "One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up.", "However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3\u201311.5 \u00b5m) and the near-infrared channel (1.58\u20131.64 \u00b5m), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a fog satellite picture.", "The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.", "The sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows.", "This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft.", "Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.", "Near-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye, mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum.", "Other definitions follow different physical mechanisms (emission peaks, vs. bands, water absorption) and the newest follow technical reasons (the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050 nm, while InGaAs's sensitivity starts around 950 nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600 nm, depending on the specific configuration).", "Unfortunately, international standards for these specifications are not currently available.", "Heat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference.", "Unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection, thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum.", "Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature.", "Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (i.e., the solar corona).", "Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.", "Thermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900\u201314,000 nanometers or 0.9\u201314 \u03bcm) and produce images of that radiation.", "Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to \"see\" one's environment with or without visible illumination.", "The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).", "The infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers.", "Cold, dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars.", "Infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light.", "Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected.", "(In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)", "Infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see.", "Night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light.", "Infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices, increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source.", "IR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants.", "These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association.", "Remote controls

not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms.", "Infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances.", "Infrared remote control protocols like RC-5, SIRC, are used to communicate with infrared.", "In the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures.", "By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations.", "The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.", "Infrared cleaning is a technique used by some Motion picture film scanner, film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan.", "It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue).", "The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust.", "Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.", "Earth's surface and the clouds absorb visible and invisible radiation from the sun and re-emit much of the energy as infrared back to atmosphere.", "Certain substances in the atmosphere, chiefly cloud droplets and water vapor, but also carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur hexafluoride, and chlorofluorocarbons, absorb this infrared, and re-radiate it in all directions including back to Earth.", "Thus, the greenhouse effect keeps the atmosphere and surface much warmer than if the infrared absorbers were absent from the atmosphere."]}, {"qa": [{"answer": "United States", "question": "What country is Guam a territory of?", "answer_sentence": 0}, {"answer":

entire 20th century, as each new system became more HD than the last.In the beginning of the 21st century, this race has continued with 4k, 5k and current 8K systems.", "The British high-definition TV service started trials in August 1936 and a regular service on 2 November 1936 using both the (mechanical) Baird 240 line sequential scan (later to be inaccurately rechristened 'progressive') and the (electronic) Marconi-EMI 405 line interlaced systems.", "The Baird system was discontinued in February 1937.", "In 1938 France followed with their own 441-line system, variants of which were also used by a number of other countries.", "The US NTSC 525-line system joined in 1941.", "In 1949 France introduced an even higher-resolution standard at 819 lines, a system that should have been high definition even by today's standards, but was monochrome only and the technical limitations of the time prevented it from achieving the definition of which it should have been capable.", "All of these systems used interlacing and a 4:3 aspect ratio except the 240-line system which was progressive (actually described at the time by the technically correct term \"sequential\") and the 405-line system which started as 5:4 and later changed to 4:3.", "The 405-line system adopted the (at that time) revolutionary idea of interlaced scanning to overcome the flicker problem of the 240-line with its 25 Hz frame rate.", "The 240-line system could have doubled its frame rate but this would have meant that the transmitted signal would have doubled in bandwidth, an unacceptable option as the video baseband bandwidth was required to be not more than 3 MHz.", "Colour broadcasts started at similarly higher resolutions, first with the US NTSC color system in 1953, which was compatible with the earlier monochrome systems and therefore had the same 525 lines of resolution.", "European standards did not follow until the 1960s, when the PAL and SECAM color systems were added to the monochrome 625 line broadcasts.", "The Nippon H\u014ds\u014d Ky\u014dkai (NHK, the Japan Broadcasting Corporation) began conducting research to \"unlock the fundamental mechanism of video and sound interactions

producing an image composed of 1,125 lines of resolution aimed at providing teleconferencing for military command.", "It was a research project and the system was never deployed by either the military or consumer broadcasting.", "In 1979, the Japanese state broadcaster NHK first developed consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio.", "The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125

Washington, US President Ronald Reagan was impressed and officially declared it \"a matter of national interest\" to introduce HDTV to the US.", "Several systems were proposed as the new standard for the US, including the Japanese MUSE system, but all were rejected by the FCC because of their higher bandwidth requirements.", "At this time, the number of television channels was growing rapidly and bandwidth was already a problem.", "A new standard had to be more efficient, needing less bandwidth for HDTV than the existing NTSC.", "The limited standardization of analog HDTV in the 1990s did not lead to global HDTV adoption as technical and economic constraints at the time did not permit HDTV to use bandwidths greater than normal television.", "Early HDTV commercial experiments, such as NHK's MUSE, required over four times the bandwidth of a standard-definition broadcast.", "Despite efforts made to reduce analog HDTV to about twice the bandwidth of SDTV, these television formats were still distributable only by satellite.", "In addition, recording and reproducing an HDTV signal was a significant technical challenge in the early years of HDTV (Sony HDVS).", "Japan remained the only country with successful public broadcasting of analog HDTV, with seven broadcasters sharing a single channel.", "Since 1972, International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector

proposed ATSC as the new standard for SDTV and HDTV.", "Both ATSC and DVB were based on the MPEG-2 standard, although DVB systems may also be used to transmit video using the newer and more efficient H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression standards.", "Common for all DVB standards is the use of highly efficient modulation techniques for further reducing bandwidth, and foremost for reducing receiver-hardware and antenna requirements.", "In 1983, the International Telecommunication Union's radio telecommunications sector (ITU-R) set up a working party (IWP11/6) with the aim of setting a single international HDTV standard.", "One of the thornier issues concerned a suitable frame/field refresh rate, the world already having split into two camps, 25/50 Hz and 30/60 Hz, largely due to the differences in mains frequency.", "The IWP11/6 working party considered many views and throughout the 1980s served to encourage development in a number of video digital processing areas, not least conversion between the two main frame/field rates using motion vectors, which led to further developments in other areas.", "While a comprehensive HDTV standard was not in the end established, agreement on the aspect ratio was achieved.", "Initially the existing 5:3 aspect ratio had been the main candidate but, due to the influence of widescreen cinema, the aspect ratio 16:9 (1.78) eventually emerged as being a reasonable compromise between 5:3 (1.67) and the common 1.85 widescreen cinema format.", "An aspect ratio of 16:9 was duly agreed upon at the first meeting of the IWP11/6 working party at the BBC's Research and Development establishment in Kingswood Warren.", "The resulting ITU-R Recommendation ITU-R BT.709-2 (\"Rec. 709\") includes the 16:9 aspect ratio, a specified

the fractional rates were often rounded up to whole numbers, e.g. 23.976p was often called 24p, or 59.94i was often called 60i. 60 Hz high definition television supports both fractional and slightly different integer rates, therefore strict usage of notation is required to avoid ambiguity.", "Nevertheless, 29.97i/59.94i is almost universally called 60i, likewise 23.976p is called 24p.", "For the

24p means 24 progressive scan frames per second, and 50i means 25 interlaced frames per second.", "There is no single standard for HDTV color support.", "Colors are typically broadcast using a (10-bits per channel) YUV color space but, depending on the underlying image generating technologies of the receiver, are then subsequently converted to a RGB color space using standardized algorithms.", "When transmitted directly through the Internet, the colors are typically pre-converted to 8-bit RGB channels for additional storage savings with the assumption that it will only be viewed only on a (sRGB) computer screen.", "As an added benefit to the original broadcasters, the losses of the pre-conversion essentially make these files unsuitable for professional TV re-broadcasting.", "At a minimum, HDTV has twice the linear resolution of standard-definition television (SDTV), thus showing greater detail than either analog television or regular DVD.", "The technical standards for broadcasting HDTV also handle the 16:9 aspect ratio images without using letterboxing or anamorphic stretching, thus increasing the effective image resolution.", "A very high resolution source may require more bandwidth than available in order to be transmitted without loss of fidelity.", "The lossy compression that is used in all digital HDTV storage and transmission systems will distort the received picture, when compared to the uncompressed source.", "The optimum format for a broadcast depends upon the type of videographic recording medium used and the image's characteristics.", "For best fidelity to the source the transmitted field ratio, lines, and frame rate should match those of the source.", "PAL, SECAM and NTSC frame rates technically apply only to analogue standard definition television, not to digital or high definition broadcasts.", "However, with the roll out of digital broadcasting, and later HDTV broadcasting, countries retained their heritage systems.", "HDTV in former PAL and SECAM countries operates at a frame rate of 25/50 Hz, while HDTV in former NTSC countries operates at 30/60 Hz.", "Standard 35mm photographic film used for cinema projection has a much higher image resolution than HDTV systems, and is exposed and projected at a rate of 24 frames per second (frame/s).", "To be shown on standard television, in PAL-system countries, cinema film is scanned at the TV rate of 25 frame/s, causing a speedup of 4.1 percent, which is generally considered acceptable.", "In NTSC-system countries, the TV scan rate of 30 frame/s would cause a perceptible speedup if the same were attempted, and the necessary correction is performed by a technique called 3:2 Pulldown: Over each successive pair of film frames, one is held for three video fields (1/20 of a second) and the next is held for two video fields (1/30 of a second), giving a total time for the two frames of 1/12 of a second and thus achieving the correct average film frame rate.", "Non-cinematic HDTV video recordings intended for broadcast are typically recorded either in 720p or 1080i format as determined by the broadcaster. 720p is commonly used for Internet distribution of high-definition video, because most computer monitors operate in progressive-scan mode. 720p also imposes less strenuous storage and decoding requirements compared to both 1080i and 1080p. 1080p/24, 1080i/30, 1080i/25, and 720p/30 is most often used on Blu-ray Disc.", "In the US, residents in the line of sight of television station broadcast antennas can receive free,

cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export.", "In the days of the Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now salination is widespread.", "Genetically modified (GM) cotton was developed to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides.", "The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to a small fraction of insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life.", "The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called Bt cotton, to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues.", "In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat.", "This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance).", "This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.", "But Bt cotton is ineffective against many cotton pests, however, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; depending on circumstances it may still be desirable to use insecticides against these.", "A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds.", "However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this.", "They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm.", "The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied.", "Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption.", "A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders.", "The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011.", "This was 69% of the worldwide total area planted in cotton.", "GM cotton acreage in India grew at a rapid rate, increasing from 50,000 hectares in 2002 to 10.6 million hectares in 2011.", "The total cotton area in India was 12.1 million hectares in 2011, so GM cotton was grown on 88% of the cotton area.", "This made India the country with the largest area of GM cotton in the world.", "A long-term study on the economic impacts of Bt cotton in India, published in the Journal PNAS in 2012, showed that Bt cotton has increased yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers.", "The U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton crop area of 2.6 million hectares in 2011.", "The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia \u2013 the yields were equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce (85% reduction).", "The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009 making Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the world.", "Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa Rica.", "Organic cotton is generally understood as cotton from plants not genetically modified

cycles.", "In the United States, organic cotton plantations are required to enforce the National Organic Program (NOP).", "This institution determines the allowed practices for pest control, growing, fertilizing, and handling of organic crops.", "As of 2007, 265,517 bales of organic cotton were produced in 24 countries, and worldwide production was growing at a rate of more than 50% per year.", "Historically, in North America, one of the most economically destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil.", "Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States.", "This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.", "Most cotton in the United States, Europe and Australia is harvested mechanically, either by a cotton picker, a machine that removes the cotton from the boll without damaging the cotton plant, or by a cotton stripper, which strips the entire boll off the plant.", "Cotton strippers are used in regions where it is too windy to grow picker varieties of cotton, and usually after application of a chemical defoliant or the natural defoliation that occurs after a freeze.", "Cotton is a perennial crop in the tropics, and without defoliation or freezing, the plant will continue to grow.", "The era of manufactured fibers began with the development of rayon in France in the 1890s.", "Rayon is derived from a natural cellulose and cannot be considered synthetic, but requires extensive processing in a manufacturing process, and led the less expensive replacement of more naturally derived materials.", "A succession of new synthetic fibers were introduced by the chemicals industry in the following decades.", "Acetate in fiber form was developed in 1924.", "Nylon, the first fiber synthesized entirely from petrochemicals, was introduced as a sewing thread by DuPont in 1936, followed by DuPont's acrylic in 1944.", "Some garments were created from fabrics based on these fibers, such as women's hosiery from nylon, but it was not until the introduction of polyester into the fiber marketplace in the early 1950s that the market for cotton came under threat.", "The rapid uptake of polyester garments in the 1960s caused economic hardship in cotton-exporting economies, especially in Central American countries, such as Nicaragua, where cotton production had boomed tenfold between 1950 and 1965 with the advent of cheap chemical pesticides.", "Cotton production recovered in the 1970s, but crashed to pre-1960 levels in the early 1990s.", "Beginning as a self-help program in the mid-1960s, the Cotton Research and Promotion Program (CRPP) was organized by U.S. cotton producers in response to cotton's steady decline in market share.", "At that time, producers voted to set up a per-bale assessment system to fund the program, with built-in safeguards to protect their investments.", "With the passage of the Cotton Research and Promotion Act of 1966, the program joined forces and began battling synthetic competitors and re-establishing markets for cotton.", "Today, the success of this program has made cotton the best-selling fiber in the U.S. and one of the best-selling fibers in the world.", "[citation needed]", "Cotton is used to make a number of textile products.", "These include terrycloth for highly absorbent bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from

also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting.", "Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process.", "While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester.", "It can either be used in knitted

remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage.", "Gossypol was one of the many substances found in all parts of the cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'.", "It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm.", "Also, it is thought to interfere with the menstrual cycle by restricting the release of certain hormones.", "Cotton linters are fine, silky fibers which adhere to the seeds of the cotton plant after ginning.", "These curly fibers typically are less than 1\u20448 inch (3.2 mm) long.", "The term also may apply to the longer textile fiber staple lint as well as the shorter fuzzy fibers from some upland species.", "Linters are traditionally used in the manufacture of paper and as a raw material in the manufacture of cellulose.", "In the UK, linters are referred to as \"cotton wool\".", "This can also be a refined product (absorbent cotton in U.S. usage) which has medical,

the two genomes is the amplification of retrotransposons (GORGE).", "Once both diploid genomes are assembled, then research could begin sequencing the actual genomes of cultivated cotton varieties.", "This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences respectively.", "Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.", "The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources.", "The public-sector effort has generated Sanger

Kingdom, but also internationally, founded for the advancement of architecture under its charter granted in 1837 and Supplemental Charter granted in 1971.", "Originally named the Institute of British Architects in London, it was formed in 1834 by several prominent architects, including Philip Hardwick, Thomas Allom, William Donthorne, Thomas Leverton Donaldson, William Adams Nicholson, John Buonarotti Papworth, and Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey.", "After the grant of the royal charter it had become known as the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892.", "In 1934, it moved to its current headquarters on Portland Place, with the building being opened by King George V and Queen Mary.", "It was granted its Royal Charter in 1837 under King William IV.", "Supplemental Charters of 1887, 1909 and 1925 were replaced by a single Charter in 1971, and there have been minor amendments since then.", "The original Charter of 1837 set out the purpose of the Royal Institute to be: '\u2026 the general advancement of Civil Architecture, and for promoting and facilitating the acquirement of the knowledge of the various arts and sciences connected therewith\u2026'", "The operational framework is provided by the Byelaws, which are more frequently updated than the Charter.", "Any revisions to the Charter or Byelaws require the Privy Council's approval.", "The design of the Institute's Mycenean lions medal and the motto \u2018Usui civium, decori urbium' has been attributed to Thomas Leverton Donaldson, who had been honorary secretary until 1839.", "The RIBA Guide to its Archive and History (Angela Mace,1986) records that the first official version of this badge was used as a bookplate for the Institute's library and publications from 1835 to 1891, when it was redesigned by J.H.Metcalfe.", "It was again redesigned in 1931 by Eric Gill and in 1960 by Joan Hassall.", "The description in the 1837 by-laws was: \"gules, two lions rampant guardant or, supporting a column marked with lines chevron, proper, all standing on a base of the same; a garter surrounding the whole with the inscription Institute of British Architects, anno salutis MDCCCXXXIV; above a mural crown proper, and beneath the motto Usui civium decori urbium \".", "In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the RIBA and its members had a leading part in the promotion of architectural education in the United Kingdom, including the establishment of the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom (ARCUK) and the Board of Architectural Education under the Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938.", "A member of the RIBA, Lionel Bailey Budden, then Associate Professor in the Liverpool University School of Architecture, had contributed the article on Architectural Education published in the fourteenth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (1929).", "His School, Liverpool, was one of the twenty schools named for the purpose of constituting the statutory Board of Architectural Education when the 1931 Act was passed.", "Soon after the passing of the 1931 Act, in the book published on the occasion of the Institute's centenary celebration in 1934, Harry Barnes, FRIBA, Chairman of the Registration Committee, mentioned that ARCUK could not be a rival of any architectural association, least of all the RIBA, given the way ARCUK was constituted.", "Barnes commented that the Act's purpose was not protecting the architectural profession, and that the legitimate interests of the profession were best served by the (then) architectural associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture were to be found.", "The RIBA Guide to its Archive and History (1986) has a section on the \"Statutory registration of architects\" with a bibliography extending from a draft bill of 1887 to one of 1969.", "The Guide's section on \"Education\" records the setting up in 1904 of the RIBA Board of Architectural Education, and the system by which any school which applied for recognition, whose syllabus was approved by the Board and whose examinations were conducted by an approved external examiner, and whose standard of attainment was guaranteed by periodical inspections by a \"Visiting Board\" from the BAE, could be placed on the list of \"recognized schools\" and its successful students could qualify for exemption from RIBA examinations.", "The content of the acts, particularly section 1 (1) of the amending act of 1938, shows the importance which was then attached to giving architects the responsibility of superintending or supervising the building works of local authorities (for housing and other projects), rather than persons professionally qualified only as municipal or other engineers.", "By the 1970s another issue had emerged affecting education for qualification and registration for practice as an architect, due to the obligation imposed on the United Kingdom and other European governments to comply with European Union Directives concerning mutual recognition of professional qualifications in favour of equal standards across borders, in furtherance of the policy for a single market of the European Union.", "This led to proposals for reconstituting ARCUK.", "Eventually, in the 1990s, before proceeding, the government issued a consultation paper \"Reform of Architects Registration\" (1994).", "The change of name to \"Architects Registration Board\" was one of the proposals which was later enacted in the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 and reenacted as the Architects Act 1997; another was the abolition of the ARCUK Board of Architectural Education.", "RIBA Visiting Boards continue to assess courses for exemption from the RIBA's examinations in architecture.", "Under arrangements made in 2011 the validation criteria are jointly held by the RIBA and the Architects Registration Board, but unlike the ARB, the RIBA also validates courses outside the UK.", "The RIBA is a member organisation, with 44,000 members.", "Chartered Members are entitled to call themselves chartered architects and to append the post-nominals RIBA after their name; Student Members are not permitted to do so.", "Formerly, fellowships of the institute were granted, although no longer; those who continue to hold this title instead add FRIBA.", "RIBA is based at 66 Portland Place, London\u2014a 1930s Grade II* listed building designed by architect George Grey Wornum with sculptures by Edward Bainbridge Copnall and James Woodford.", "Parts of the London building are open to the public, including the Library.", "It has a large architectural bookshop, a caf\u00e9, restaurant and lecture theatres.", "Rooms are hired out for events.", "The Institute also maintains a dozen regional offices around the United Kingdom, it opened its first regional office for the East of England at Cambridge in 1966.", "RIBA Enterprises is the commercial arm of RIBA, with a registered office in Newcastle upon Tyne, a base at 15 Bonhill Street in London, and an office in Newark.", "It employs over 250 staff, approximately 180 of whom are based in Newcastle.", "Its services include RIBA Insight, RIBA Appointments, and RIBA Publishing.", "It publishes the RIBA Product Selector and RIBA Journal.", "In Newcastle is the NBS, the National Building Specification, which has 130 staff and deals with the building regulations and the Construction Information Service.", "RIBA Bookshops, which operates online and at 66 Portland Place, is also part of RIBA Enterprises.", "The British Architectural Library, sometimes referred to as the RIBA Library, was established in 1834 upon the founding of the institute with donations from members.", "Now, with over four million items, it is one of the three largest architectural libraries in the world and the largest in Europe.", "Some items from the collections are on permanent display at the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) in the V&A + RIBA Architecture Gallery and included in temporary exhibitions at the RIBA and across Europe and North America.", "Its collections include:", "The overcrowded conditions of the library was one of the reasons why the RIBA moved from 9 Conduit Street to larger premises at 66 Portland Place in 1934.", "The library remained open throughout World War Two and was able to shelter the archives of Modernist architect Adolf Loos during the war.", "The library is based at two public sites: the Reading Room at the RIBA's headquarters, 66 Portland Place, London; and the RIBA Architecture Study Rooms in the Henry Cole Wing of the V&A.", "The Reading Room, designed by the building's architect George Grey Wornum and his wife Miriam, retains its original 1934 Art Deco interior with open bookshelves, original furniture and double-height central space.", "The study rooms, opened in 2004, were designed by Wright & Wright.", "The library is funded entirely by the RIBA but it is open to the public without charge.", "It operates a free education programme aimed at students, education groups and families, and an information service for RIBA members and the public through the RIBA Information Centre.", "Since 2004, through the V&A + RIBA Architecture Partnership, the RIBA and V&A have worked together to promote the understanding and enjoyment of architecture.", "In 2004, the two institutions created the Architecture Gallery (Room 128) at the V&A showing artefacts from the collections of both institutions, this was the first permanent gallery devoted to architecture in the UK.", "The adjacent Architecture Exhibition Space (Room 128a) is used for temporary displays related to architecture.", "Both spaces were designed by Gareth Hoskins Architects.", "At the same time the RIBA Library Drawing and Archives Collections moved from 21 Portman Place to new facilities in the Henry Cole Wing at the V&A.", "Under the Partnership new study rooms were opened where members of the public could view items from the RIBA and V&A architectural collections under the supervision of curatorial staff.", "These and the nearby education room were designed by Wright & Wright Architects.", "RIBA runs many awards including the Stirling Prize for the best new building of the year, the Royal Gold Medal (first awarded in 1848), which honours a distinguished body of work, and the Stephen Lawrence Prize for projects with a construction budget of less than \u00a3500,000.", "The RIBA also awards the President's Medals for student work, which are regarded as the most prestigious awards in architectural education, and the RIBA President's Awards for Research.", "The RIBA European Award was inaugurated in 2005 for work in the European Union, outside the UK.", "The RIBA National Award and the RIBA International Award were established in 2007.", "Since 1966, the RIBA also judges regional awards which are presented locally in the UK regions (East, East Midlands, London, North East, North West, Northern Ireland, Scotland, South/South East, South West/Wessex, Wales, West Midlands and Yorkshire).", "Architectural design competitions are used by an organisation that plans to build a new building or refurbish an existing building.", "They can be used for buildings, engineering work, structures, landscape design projects or public realm artworks.", "A competition typically asks for architects and/or designers to submit a design proposal in response to a given Brief.", "The winning design will then be selected by an independent jury panel of design professionals and client representatives.", "The independence of the jury is vital to the fair conduct of a competition.", "In addition to the Architects Registration Board, the RIBA provides accreditation to architecture schools in the UK under a course validation procedure.", "It also provides validation to international courses without input from the ARB.", "The RIBA has three parts to the education process: Part I which is generally a three-year first degree, a year-out of at least one year work experience in an architectural practice precedes the Part II which is generally a two-year post graduate diploma or masters.", "A further year out must be taken before the RIBA Part III professional exams can be taken.", "Overall it takes a minimum of seven years before an architecture student can seek chartered status.", "In 2007, RIBA called for minimum space standards in newly built British houses after research was published suggesting that British houses were falling behind other European countries.", "\"The average new home sold to people today is significantly smaller than that built

chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use.", "Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase , gastric phase, and intestinal phase.", "The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex.", "Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata.", "After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine.", "Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate.", "Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin.", "The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours.", "It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH.", "Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes.", "This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices.", "As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach.", "Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted.", "This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid.", "Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3.", "Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.", "The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory.", "Partially digested food fills the duodenum.", "This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released.", "Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes.", "In a channel transupport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria.", "It is a simple system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP)[specify].", "This secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 - 900 kDa).", "The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa.", "In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles.", "Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials.", "Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells.", "While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.", "Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis.", "Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an \"overhead charge\" on the energy made available from absorbed substances.", "Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures.", "Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.).", "Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes.", "Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis.", "Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection.", "In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach.", "The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme.", "In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice.", "The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine.", "Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose.", "Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine.", "Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods.", "This is commonly known as lactose intolerance.", "Lactose intolerance varies widely by ethnic heritage; more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent.", "After some time (typically 1\u20132 hours in humans, 4\u20136 hours in dogs, 3\u20134 hours in house cats),[citation needed] the resulting thick liquid is called chyme.", "When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues.", "When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine.", "Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9.", "Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon.", "Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation.", "In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach.", "Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches.", "The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes.", "Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation.", "Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids.", "The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens.", "For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin.", "Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides."]}, {"qa": [{"answer": "Philosophy of space and time", "question": "Which philosophy branch is concerned with issues surrounding ontology?", "answer_sentence": 0},

far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate.", "But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric.", "The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is overwhelmingly likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.", "A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric.", "For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition.", "But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.", "[citation needed]", "One recent proponent of the laws solution is Tim Maudlin who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin ).", "However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: \"[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world...", "It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past\" [ibid, 2010 edition, p. 108].", "Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.", "The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart.", "In this paper McTaggart proposes two \"temporal series\".", "The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series.", "The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, simpliciter and in comparison to each other.", "The B-series eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations earlier than and later than.", "According to Presentism, time is an ordering of various realities.", "At a certain time some things exist and others do not.", "This is the only reality we can deal with and we cannot for example say that Homer exists because at the present time he does not.", "An Eternalist, on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things\u2014past, present, and future\u2014can be said to be just as real as things in the present.", "According to this theory, then, Homer really does exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time\u2014just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words near, far, above, below, and such are directly comparable to phrases such as in the past, a minute ago, and so on).", "The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar.", "An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them).", "A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its \"temporal parts\" or instances of existing.", "Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists have attacked this position.", "(An example of a perdurantist is David Lewis.)", "One argument perdurantists use to state the superiority of their view is that perdurantism is able to take account of change in objects.", "However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid.", "In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc.", "However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup.", "The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water.", "This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling.", "In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other."]}, {"qa":

premiere of 26.5 million.", "The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 18\u201349 age group.", "The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever American Idol episode at 38.1 million for the final hour.", "By season three, the show had become the top show in the 18\u201349 demographic a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including season ten, and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings.", "By season four, American Idol had become the most watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time, with an average viewership of 26.8 million.", "The show reached its peak in season five with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode, and season five remains the highest-rated season of the series.", "Season six premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most watched episodes of American Idol.", "During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before, as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's The Cosby Show.", "The show was dubbed \"the Death Star\", and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.", "However, season six also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season.", "The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year.", "Season six was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.", "The loss of viewers continued into season seven.", "The premiere was down 11% among total viewers, and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 18\u201334 demo since the first season in 2002.", "However, the ratings rebounded for the season seven finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over season six as the series' third most watched finale.", "The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception, a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network.", "Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from season six, which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike.", "The declining trend however continued into season eight, as total viewers numbers fell by 5\u201310% for early episodes compared to season seven, and by 9% for the finale.", "In season nine, Idol's six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat Idol in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over Idol's 18.4 million.", "Nevertheless, American Idol overall finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS' All in the Family and NBC's The Cosby Show.", "In season ten, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 12\u201313%, and by up to 23% in the 18\u201349 demo compared to season nine.", "Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and the season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale \u2013 up 12% for the adults 18\u201349 demo and a 21% increase in total viewers from the season nine finale.", "While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year \u2013 the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season.", "By the time of the 2010\u201311 television season, Fox was in its seventh consecutive season of victory overall in the 18\u201349 demographic ratings in the United States.", "Season eleven, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as The Voice and The X-Factor.", "The ratings for the first two episodes of season eleven fell 16\u201321% in overall viewer numbers and 24\u201327% in the 18/49 demo, while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18-49 demo.", "The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo.", "For the first time in eight years, American Idol lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to NBC Sunday Night Football, although the strengths of Idol in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18-49 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.", "The loss of viewers continued into season 12, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18-49 demo.", "The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18-49 demo.", "The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season.", "The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18\u201349 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and American Idol lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013\u201314 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, although the entire series to date had not yet been dropped from the Nielsen Top 30 rankings since its inception in 2002.", "The continuing decline influenced further changes for season 14, including the loss of Coca-Cola as the show's major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show).", "On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of American Idol would be its last.", "Despite these changes, the show's ratings would decline more sharply.", "The fourteenth season finale was the lowest-rated finale ever, with an average of only 8.03 million viewers watching the finale.", "The enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated was transformative for Fox Broadcasting Company.", "American Idol and fellow competing shows Survivor and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire were altogether credited for expanding reality television programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and Idol became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by drama shows and sitcoms in the preceding decades).", "The show pushed Fox to become the number one U.S. TV network amongst adults 18\u201349, the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented eight consecutive years by 2012.", "Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as House and Bones, and Idol, for years, had become Fox's strongest platform primetime television program for promoting eventual hit shows of the 2010s (of the same network) such as Glee and New Girl.", "The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, \"saved Fox\".", "The show's massive success in the mid-2000s and early 2010s spawned a number of imitating singing-competition shows, such as Rock Star, Nashville Star, The Voice, Rising Star, The Sing-Off, and The X Factor.", "Its format also served as a blueprint for non-singing TV shows such as Dancing with the Stars and So You Think You Can Dance, most of which contribute to the current highly competitive reality TV landscape on American television.", "As one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, American Idol has a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment.", "It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability.", "Various American Idol alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the Billboard charts in its first ten years.", "According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and best-selling albums and singles.", "In 2007, American Idol alums accounted for 2.1% of all music sales.", "Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, American Idol had become \"a dominant force in radio\" according to the president of the research company Mediabase which monitors radio stations Rich Meyer.", "By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.", "As of 2013, the American Idol alumni in their post-Idol careers have amassed over 59 million albums and 120 million singles and digital track downloads in the United States alone.", "The

been noted and commented on.", "The casting of a popular Idol contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales.", "Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the Idol vocal coach Debra Byrd, won a role in Dreamgirls and subsequently received an Academy Award for her performance.", "Early reviews were mixed in their assessment.", "Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered that \"As TV, American Idol is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\".", "Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\".", "It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\".", "Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms.", "The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations \u2013 Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune charged that American Idol is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\".", "The decision to send the season one winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many.", "Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great American Idol Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made American Idol a hit.", "Them

Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business.\"", "Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show \"undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism\".", "Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has \"reshaped the American songbook\", \"led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture\", and connects \"the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.\"", "Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that \"Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.\"", "Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.", "Some in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show.", "Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the \"true art form of music\", thought that shows like American Idol made it seem \"so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight\", and that \"television is a lie\".", "Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that American Idol \"isn't really about music.", "It's about all the bad aspects of the music business \u2013 the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.'", "\" That American Idol is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry.", "LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that \"Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award\".", "It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others.", "Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on American Idol, commenting on talent shows in general, said that \"there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\".", "The success of the show's alumni however has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having \"proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records\".", "While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format.", "According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, \"if you want to

legislation.", "In 1978, Hayek came into conflict with the Liberal Party leader, David Steel, who claimed that liberty was possible only with \"social justice and an equitable distribution of wealth and power, which in turn require a degree of active government intervention\" and that the Conservative Party were more concerned with the connection between liberty and private enterprise than between liberty and democracy.", "Hayek claimed that a limited democracy might be better than other forms of limited government at protecting liberty but that an unlimited democracy was worse than other forms of unlimited government because \"its government loses the power even to do what it thinks right if any group on which its majority depends thinks otherwise\".", "In 1984, he was appointed

D. Dickinson and Oskar Lange, responded by invoking general equilibrium theory, which they argued disproved Mises's thesis.", "They noted that the difference between a planned and a free market system lay in who was responsible for solving the equations.", "They argued, if some of the prices chosen by socialist managers were wrong, gluts or shortages would appear, signalling them to adjust the prices up or down, just as in a free market.", "Through such a trial and error, a socialist economy could mimic the efficiency of a free market system, while avoiding its many problems.", "In The Use of Knowledge in Society (1945), Hayek argued that the price mechanism serves to share and synchronise local and personal knowledge, allowing society's members to achieve diverse, complicated ends through a principle of spontaneous self-organization.", "He contrasted the use of the price mechanism with central planning, arguing that the former allows for more rapid adaptation to changes in particular circumstances of time and place.", "Thus, he set the stage for Oliver Williamson's later contrast between markets and hierarchies as alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions.", "He used the term catallaxy to describe a \"self-organizing system of voluntary co-operation\".", "Hayek's research into this argument was specifically cited by the Nobel Committee in its press release awarding Hayek the Nobel prize.", "Hayek was one of the leading academic critics of collectivism in the 20th century.", "Hayek argued that all forms of collectivism (even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind.", "In Hayek's view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the rule of law, with as little arbitrary intervention as possible.", "In his popular book, The Road to Serfdom (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards totalitarianism.", "Hayek also wrote that the state can play a role in the economy, and specifically, in creating a \"safety net\".", "He wrote, \"There is no reason why, in a society which has reached the general level of wealth ours has, the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom;

methodological focus for universities and a more mechanistic orientation was emerging.", "The hierarchical place of theological knowledge had for the most part been displaced and the humanities had become a fixture, and a new openness was beginning to take hold in the construction and dissemination of knowledge that were to become imperative for the formation of the modern state.", "The epistemological tensions between scientists and universities were also heightened by the economic realities of research during this time, as individual scientists, associations and universities were vying for limited resources.", "There was also competition from the formation of new colleges funded by private benefactors and designed to provide free education to the public, or established by local governments to provide a knowledge hungry populace with an alternative to traditional universities.", "Even when universities supported new scientific endeavors, and the university provided

45% held university posts.", "It was the case that the academic foundations remaining from the Middle Ages were stable, and they did provide for an environment that fostered considerable growth and development.", "There was considerable reluctance on the part of universities to relinquish the symmetry and comprehensiveness provided by the Aristotelian system, which was effective as a coherent system for understanding and interpreting the world.", "However, university professors still utilized some autonomy, at least in the sciences, to choose epistemological foundations and methods.", "For instance, Melanchthon and his disciples at University of Wittenberg were instrumental for integrating Copernican mathematical constructs into astronomical debate and instruction.", "Another example

scientific problems as well as demonstrated an openness to change.", "There are many examples which belie the commonly perceived intransigence of universities.", "Although universities may have been slow to accept new sciences and methodologies as they emerged, when they did accept new ideas it helped to convey legitimacy and respectability, and supported the scientific changes through providing a stable environment for instruction and material resources.", "Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed.", "Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also

dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited.", "Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV.", "As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages.", "The breakdown voltage is critically affected by factors such as the geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown.", "Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit.", "The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy.", "Ripple current is the AC component of an applied source (often a

capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage.", "A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube.", "In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail.", "Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production and the use of modern polyester dielectric barriers this

voltage.", "If a capacitor is driven with a time-varying voltage that changes rapidly enough, at some frequency the polarization of the dielectric cannot follow the voltage.", "As an example of the origin of this mechanism, the internal microscopic dipoles contributing to the dielectric constant cannot move instantly, and so as frequency of an applied alternating voltage increases, the dipole response is limited and the dielectric constant diminishes.", "A changing dielectric constant with frequency is referred to as dielectric dispersion, and is governed by dielectric relaxation

department responsible for administration and formation of defence policy), which also exists as the civilian support system for the Forces.", "The Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Armed Forces is the reigning Canadian monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, who is represented by the Governor General of Canada.", "The Canadian Armed Forces is led by the Chief of the Defence Staff, who is advised and assisted by the Armed Forces Council.", "During the Cold War, a principal focus of Canadian defence policy was contributing to the security of Europe in the face of the Soviet military threat.", "Toward that end, Canadian ground and air forces were based in Europe from the early 1950s until the early 1990s.", "However, since the end of the Cold War, as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has moved much of its defence focus \"out of area\", the Canadian military has also become more deeply engaged in international security operations in various other parts of the world \u2013 most notably in Afghanistan since 2002.", "Canadian defence policy today is based on the Canada First Defence Strategy, introduced in 2008.", "Based on that strategy, the Canadian military is oriented and being equipped to carry out six core missions within Canada, in North America and globally.", "Specifically, the Canadian Armed Forces are tasked with having the capacity to:", "Consistent with the missions and priorities outlined above, the Canadian Armed Forces also contribute to the conduct of Canadian defence diplomacy through a range of activities, including the deployment of Canadian Defence Attach\u00e9s, participation in bilateral and multilateral military forums (e.g. the System of Cooperation Among the American Air Forces), ship and aircraft visits, military training and cooperation, and other such outreach and relationship-building efforts.", "Prior to Confederation in 1867, residents of the colonies in what is now Canada served as regular members of French and British forces and in local militia groups.", "The latter aided in the defence of their respective territories against attacks by other European powers, Aboriginal peoples, and later American forces during the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812, as well as in the Fenian raids, Red River Rebellion, and North-West Rebellion.", "Consequently, the lineages of some Canadian army units stretch back to the early 19th century, when militia units were formed to assist in the defence of British North America against invasion by the United States.", "The responsibility for military command remained with the British Crown-in-Council, with a commander-in-chief for North America stationed at Halifax until the final withdrawal of British Army and Royal Navy units from that city in 1906.", "Thereafter, the Royal Canadian Navy was formed, and, with the advent of military aviation, the Royal Canadian Air Force.", "These forces were organised under the Department of Militia and Defence, and split into the Permanent and Non-Permanent Active Militias\u2014frequently shortened to simply The Militia.", "By 1923, the department was merged into the Department of National Defence, but land forces in Canada were not referred to as the Canadian Army until November 1940.", "The first overseas deployment of Canadian military forces occurred during the Second Boer War, when several units were raised to serve under British command.", "Similarly, when the United Kingdom entered into conflict with Germany in the First World War, Canadian troops were called to participate in European theatres.", "The Canadian Crown-in-Council then decided to send its forces into the Second World War, as well as the Korean War.", "Since 1947, Canadian military units have participated in more than 200 operations worldwide, and completed 72 international operations.", "Canadian soldiers, sailors, and aviators came to be considered world-class professionals through conspicuous service during these conflicts and the country's integral participation in NATO during the Cold War, First Gulf War, Kosovo War, and in United Nations Peacekeeping operations, such as the Suez Crisis, Golan Heights, Cyprus, Croatia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Libya.", "Canada maintained an aircraft carrier from 1957 to 1970 during the Cold War, which never saw combat but participated in patrols during the Cuban Missile Crisis.", "Battles which are particularly notable to the Canadian military include the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Dieppe Raid, the Battle of Ortona, the Battle of Passchendaele, the Normandy Landings, the Battle for Caen, the Battle of the Scheldt, the Battle of Britain, the Battle of the Atlantic, the strategic bombing of German cities, and more recently the Battle of Medak Pocket, in

navy in the world, but with the fall of the Soviet Union, new data based on Japanese and Soviet sources found that to be incorrect.", "The current iteration of the Canadian Armed Forces dates from 1 February 1968, when the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force were merged into a unified structure and superseded by elemental commands.", "Its roots, however, lie in colonial militia groups that served alongside garrisons of the French and British armies and navies; a structure that remained in place until the early 20th century.", "Thereafter, a distinctly Canadian army and navy was established, followed by an air force, that, because of the constitutional arrangements at the time, remained effectively under the control of the British government until Canada gained legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931, in part due to the distinguished achievement and sacrifice of the Canadian Corps in the First World War.", "After the 1980s, the

Canada made efforts, through the Canada First Defence Strategy, to modernize the Canadian Armed Forces, through the purchase of new equipment, improved training and readiness, as well as the establishment of the Canadian Special Operations Regiment.", "More funds were also put towards recruitment, which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and '90s, possibly because the Canadian populace had come to perceive the CAF as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers, as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the Department of National Defence.", "The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters.", "Then CDS, Walter Natynczyk, said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful, the CF was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members, which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6% to 9.2% annually.", "The 2006 renewal and re-equipment effort has resulted in the acquisition of specific equipment (main battle tanks,

force's medium range transport aircraft fleet \u2013 the C-130 Hercules \u2013 and the army's truck and armoured vehicle fleets).", "In addition, new systems (such as C-17 Globemaster III strategic

from challenging and evolving fiscal and other factors, it originally aimed to:", "In the 1950s, the recruitment of women was open to roles in medicine, communication, logistics, and administration.", "The roles of women in the CAF began to expand in 1971, after the Department reviewed the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, at which time it lifted the ceiling of 1,500 women personnel, and gradually expanded employment opportunities into the non-traditional areas\u2014vehicle drivers and mechanics, aircraft mechanics, air-traffic controllers, military police, and firefighters.", "The Department further reviewed personnel policies in 1978 and 1985, after Parliament passed the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.", "As a result of these reviews, the Department changed its policies to permit women to serve at sea in replenishment ships and in a diving tender, with the army service battalions, in military police platoons and field ambulance units, and in most air squadrons.", "In 1987, occupations and units with the primary role of preparing for direct involvement in combat on the ground or at sea were still closed to women: infantry, armoured corps, field artillery, air-defence artillery, signals, field engineers, and naval operations.", "On 5 February 1987, the Minister of National Defence created an office to study the impact of employing men and women in combat units.", "These trials were called Combat-Related Employment of Women.", "All military occupations were open to women in 1989, with the exception of submarine service, which opened in 2000.", "Throughout the 1990s, the introduction of women into the combat arms increased the potential recruiting pool by about 100 percent.", "It also provided opportunities for all persons to serve their country to the best of their abilities.", "Women were fully integrated in all occupations and roles by the government of Jean Chretien, and by 8 March 2000, even allowed to serve on submarines.", "All equipment must be suitable for a mixed-gender force.", "Combat helmets, rucksacks, combat boots, and flak jackets are designed to ensure women have the same level of protection and comfort as their male colleagues.", "The women's uniform is similar in design to the men's uniform, but conforms to the female figure, and is functional and

1905.", "All troop deployment and disposition orders, including declarations of war, fall within the royal prerogative and are issued as Orders in Council, which must be signed by either the monarch

out of 27 Canadian Forces bases (CFB) across the country, including NDHQ.", "This number has been gradually reduced since the 1970s with bases either being closed or merged.", "Both officers and

variety of institutions throughout Canada, and to a lesser extent, the world.", "The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), headed by the Commander of the Royal Canadian Navy, includes 33 warships and submarines

physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system in vitro, in situ, and in vivo.", "Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine, particularly in the fields of organ transplantation, oncology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and dermatology.", "Prior to the designation of immunity from the etymological root immunis, which is Latin for \"exempt\"; early physicians characterized organs that would later be proven as essential components of the immune system.", "The important lymphoid organs of the immune system are the thymus and bone marrow, and chief lymphatic tissues such as spleen, tonsils, lymph vessels, lymph nodes, adenoids, and liver.", "When health conditions worsen to emergency status, portions of immune system organs including the thymus, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues can be surgically excised for examination while patients are still alive.", "Many components of the immune system are typically cellular in nature and not associated with any specific organ; but rather are embedded or circulating in various tissues located throughout the body.", "Classical immunology ties in with the fields of epidemiology and medicine.", "It studies the relationship between the body systems, pathogens, and immunity.", "The earliest written mention of immunity can be traced back to the plague of Athens in 430 BCE.", "Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.", "Many other ancient societies have references to this phenomenon, but it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries before the concept developed into scientific theory.", "The study of the molecular and cellular components that comprise the immune system, including their function and interaction, is the central science of immunology.", "The immune system has been divided into a more primitive innate immune system and, in vertebrates, an acquired or adaptive immune system.", "The latter is further divided into humoral (or antibody) and cell-mediated components.", "The humoral (antibody) response is defined as the interaction between antibodies and antigens.", "Antibodies are specific proteins released from a certain class of immune cells known as B lymphocytes, while antigens are defined as anything that elicits the generation of antibodies (\"anti\"body \"gen\"erators).", "Immunology rests on an understanding of the properties of these two biological entities and the cellular response to both.", "Immunological research continues to become more specialized, pursuing non-classical models of immunity and functions of cells, organs and systems not previously associated with the immune system (Yemeserach 2010).", "Clinical immunology is the study of diseases caused by disorders of the immune system (failure, aberrant action, and malignant growth of the cellular elements of the system).", "It also involves diseases of other systems, where immune reactions play a part in the pathology and clinical features.", "Other immune system disorders include various hypersensitivities (such as in asthma and other allergies) that respond inappropriately to otherwise harmless compounds.", "The most well-known disease that affects the immune system itself is AIDS, an immunodeficiency characterized by the suppression of CD4+ (\"helper\") T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).", "The body\u2019s capability to react to antigen depends on a person's age, antigen type, maternal factors and the area where the antigen is presented.", "Neonates are said to be in a state of physiological immunodeficiency, because both their innate and adaptive immunological responses are greatly suppressed.", "Once born, a child\u2019s immune system responds favorably to protein antigens while not as well to glycoproteins and polysaccharides.", "In fact, many of the infections acquired by neonates are caused by low virulence organisms like Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas.", "In neonates, opsonic activity and the ability to activate the complement cascade is very limited.", "For example, the mean level of C3 in a newborn is approximately 65% of that found in the adult.", "Phagocytic activity is also greatly impaired in newborns.", "This is due to lower opsonic activity, as well as diminished up-regulation of integrin and selectin receptors, which limit the ability of neutrophils to interact with adhesion molecules in the endothelium.", "Their monocytes are slow and have a reduced ATP production, which also limits the newborn's phagocytic activity.", "Although, the number of total lymphocytes is significantly higher than in adults, the cellular and humoral immunity is also impaired.", "Antigen-presenting cells in newborns have a reduced capability to activate T cells.", "Also, T cells of a newborn proliferate poorly and produce very small amounts of cytokines like IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-12, and IFN-g which limits their capacity to activate the humoral response as well as the phagocitic activity of macrophage.", "B cells develop early during gestation but are not fully active.", "Maternal factors also play a role in the body\u2019s immune response.", "At birth, most of the immunoglobulin present is maternal IgG.", "Because IgM, IgD, IgE and IgA don\u2019t cross the placenta, they are almost undetectable at birth.", "Some IgA is provided by breast milk.", "These passively-acquired antibodies can protect the newborn for up to 18 months, but their response is usually short-lived and of low affinity.", "These antibodies can also produce a negative response.", "If a child is exposed to the antibody for a particular antigen before being exposed to the antigen itself then the child will produce a dampened response.", "Passively acquired maternal antibodies can suppress the antibody response to active immunization.", "Similarly the response of T-cells to vaccination differs in children compared to adults, and vaccines that induce Th1 responses in adults do not readily elicit these same responses in neonates.", "Between six to nine months after birth, a child\u2019s immune system begins to respond more strongly to glycoproteins, but there is usually no marked improvement in their response to polysaccharides until they are at least one year old.", "This can be the reason for distinct time frames found in vaccination schedules.", "During adolescence, the human body undergoes various physical, physiological and immunological changes triggered and mediated by hormones, of which the most significant in females is 17-\u03b2-oestradiol (an oestrogen) and, in males, is testosterone.", "Oestradiol usually begins to act around the age of 10 and testosterone some months later.", "There is evidence that these steroids act directly not only on the primary and secondary sexual characteristics but also have an effect on the development and regulation of the immune system, including an increased risk in developing pubescent and post-pubescent autoimmunity.", "There is also some evidence that cell surface receptors on B cells and macrophages may detect sex hormones in the system.", "Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude.", "Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time.", "The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" theories of immunity.", "According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff, it was cells \u2013 more precisely, phagocytes \u2013 that were responsible for immune responses.", "In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring, among others, stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism\u2019s \u201chumors\u201d rather than its cells.", "In the mid-1950s, Frank Burnet, inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne, formulated the clonal selection theory (CST) of immunity.", "On the basis of CST, Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction: \"self\" constituents (constituents of the body) do not trigger destructive immune responses, while \"nonself\" entities (e.g., pathogens, an allograft) trigger a destructive immune response.", "The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex \"two-signal\" activation of T cells.", "The self/nonself theory of immunity and the self/nonself vocabulary have been criticized, but remain very influential.", "Bioscience is the overall major in which undergraduate students who are interested in general well-being take in college.", "Immunology is a branch of bioscience for undergraduate programs but the major gets specified as students move on for graduate program in immunology.", "The aim of immunology is to study the health of humans and animals through effective yet consistent research, (AAAAI, 2013).", "The most important thing about being immunologists is the research because it is the biggest portion of their jobs.", "Most graduate immunology schools follow the AAI courses immunology which are offered throughout numerous schools in the United States.", "For example, in New York State, there are

complement general biology or science training.", "It also has two different parts: Part I is an introduction to the basic principles of immunology and Part II is a clinically-oriented lecture series.", "On the other hand, the Advanced Course is another course for those who are willing to expand or update their understanding of immunology.", "It is advised for students who want to attend the Advanced Course to have a background of the principles of immunology.", "Most schools require students to take electives in other to complete their degrees.", "A Master\u2019s degree requires two

bass, and drums, the band uses several instruments associated with traditional Celtic music, including mandolin, tin whistle, and Great Highland bagpipes.", "The band explains that these instruments accentuate the growling sound they favor.", "The 1991 R.E.M. hit \"Losing My Religion\" was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck, who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs.", "The single peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (#1 on the rock and alternative charts), Luther Dickinson of North Mississippi Allstars and The Black Crowes has made

Maria McKee, the theme song to the film Days of Thunder, prominently features a mandolin.", "As in Brazil, the mandolin has played an important role in the Music of Venezuela.", "It has enjoyed a privileged position as the main melodic instrument in several different regions of the country.", "Specifically, the eastern states of Sucre, Nueva Esparta, Anzoategui and Monagas have made the mandolin the main instrument in their versions of Joropo as well as Puntos, Jotas, Polos, Fulias, Merengues and Malague\u00f1as.", "Also, in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes: Bambucos, Pasillos, Pasodobles, and Waltzes.", "In the western city of Maracaibo the Mandolin has been played in Decimas, Danzas and Contradanzas Zulianas; in the capital, Caracas, the Merengue Rucaneao, Pasodobles and Waltzes have also been played with mandolin for almost a century.", "Today, Venezuelan mandolists include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama, Jesus Rengel, Ricardo Sandoval, Saul Vera, and Cristobal Soto.", "To fill this gap in the literature, mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles.", "Some players have sought out contemporary composers to solicit new works.", "Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany, but also exist throughout the United States, Europe and the rest of the world.", "They perform works composed for mandolin family instruments, or re-orchestrations of traditional pieces.", "The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of: first and second mandolins, mandolas (either octave mandolas, tuned an octave below the mandolin, or tenor mandolas, tuned like the viola), mandocellos (tuned like the cello), and bass instruments (conventional string bass or, rarely, mandobasses).", "Smaller ensembles, such as quartets composed of two mandolins, mandola, and mandocello, may also be found."]}, {"qa": [{"answer": "2006", "question": "What year was the PlayStation 3

there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue.", "There were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis.", "The degree of uncertainty as to estimates of sea level change relative to the islands of Tuvalu was reflected in the conclusions made in 2002 from the available data.", "The 2011 report of the Pacific Climate Change Science Program published by the Australian Government, concludes: \"The sea-level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about 5 mm (0.2 in) per year.\"", "The atolls have shown resilience to gradual sea-level rise, with atolls and reef islands being able to grow under current climate conditions by generating sufficient sand and coral debris that accumulates and gets dumped on the islands during cyclones.", "Gradual sea-level rise also allows for coral polyp activity to increase the reefs.", "However, if the increase in sea level occurs at faster rate as compared to coral growth, or if polyp activity is damaged by ocean acidification, then the resilience of the atolls and reef islands is less certain.", "The 2011 report of Pacific Climate Change Science Program of Australia concludes, in relation to Tuvalu, states the conclusions that over

electrical device which converts electric power into radio waves, and vice versa.", "It is usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver.", "In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current oscillating at radio frequency (i.e. a high frequency alternating current (AC)) to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves).", "In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of an electromagnetic wave in order to produce a tiny voltage at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified.", "Typically an antenna consists of an arrangement of metallic conductors (elements), electrically connected (often through a transmission line) to the receiver or transmitter.", "An oscillating current of electrons forced through the antenna by a transmitter will create an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna elements, while the charge of the electrons also creates an oscillating electric field along the elements.", "These time-varying fields radiate away from the antenna into space as a moving transverse electromagnetic field wave.", "Conversely, during reception, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of an incoming radio wave exert force on the electrons in the antenna elements, causing them to move back and forth, creating oscillating currents in the antenna.", "The words antenna (plural: antennas in US English, although both \"antennas\" and \"antennae\" are used in International English) and aerial are used interchangeably.", "Occasionally the term \"aerial\" is used to mean a wire antenna.", "However, note the important international technical journal, the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation.", "In the United Kingdom and other areas where British English is used, the term aerial is sometimes used although 'antenna' has been universal in professional use for many years.", "The origin of the word antenna relative to wireless apparatus is attributed to Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi.", "In the summer of 1895, Marconi began testing his wireless system outdoors on his father's estate near Bologna and soon began to experiment with long wire \"aerials\".", "Marconi discovered that by raising the \"aerial\" wire above the ground and connecting the other side of his transmitter to ground, the transmission range was increased.", "Soon he was able to transmit signals over a hill, a distance of approximately 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi).", "In Italian a tent pole is known as l'antenna centrale, and the pole with the wire was simply called l'antenna.", "Until then wireless radiating transmitting and receiving elements were known simply as aerials or terminals.", "Antennas are required by any radio receiver or transmitter to couple its electrical connection to the electromagnetic field.", "Radio waves are electromagnetic waves which carry signals through the air (or through space) at the speed of light with almost no transmission loss.", "Radio transmitters and receivers are used to convey signals (information) in systems including broadcast (audio) radio, television, mobile telephones, Wi-Fi (WLAN) data networks, trunk lines and point-to-point communications links (telephone, data networks), satellite links, many remote controlled devices such as garage door openers, and wireless remote sensors, among many others.", "Radio waves are also used directly for measurements in technologies including radar, GPS, and radio astronomy.", "In each and every case, the transmitters and receivers involved require antennas, although these are sometimes hidden (such as the antenna inside an AM radio or inside a laptop computer equipped with Wi-Fi).", "One example of omnidirectional antennas is the very common vertical antenna or whip antenna consisting of a metal rod (often, but not always, a quarter of a wavelength long).", "A dipole antenna is similar but consists of two such conductors extending in opposite directions, with a total length that is often, but not always, a half of a wavelength long.", "Dipoles are typically oriented horizontally in which case they are weakly directional: signals are reasonably well radiated toward or received from all directions with the exception of the direction along the conductor itself; this region is called the antenna blind cone or null.", "Both the vertical and dipole antennas are simple in construction and relatively inexpensive.", "The dipole antenna, which is the basis for most antenna designs, is a balanced component, with equal but opposite voltages and currents applied at its two terminals through a balanced transmission line (or to a coaxial transmission line through a so-called balun).", "The vertical antenna, on the other hand, is a monopole antenna.", "It is typically connected to the inner conductor of a coaxial transmission line (or a matching network); the shield of the transmission line is connected to ground.", "In this way, the ground (or any large conductive surface) plays the role of the second conductor of a dipole, thereby forming a complete circuit.", "Since monopole antennas rely on a conductive ground, a so-called grounding structure may be employed to provide a better ground contact to the earth or which itself acts as a ground plane to perform that function regardless of (or in absence of) an actual contact with the earth.", "Antennas more complex than the dipole or vertical designs are usually intended to increase the directivity and consequently the gain of the antenna.", "This can be accomplished in many different ways leading to a plethora of antenna designs.", "The vast majority of designs are fed with a balanced line (unlike a monopole antenna) and are based on the dipole antenna with additional components (or elements) which increase its directionality.", "Antenna \"gain\" in this instance describes the concentration of radiated power into a particular solid angle of space, as opposed to the spherically uniform radiation of the ideal radiator.", "The increased power in the desired direction is at the expense of that in the undesired directions.", "Power is conserved, and there is no net power increase over that delivered from the power source (the transmitter.)", "For instance, a phased array consists of two or more simple antennas which are connected together through an electrical network.", "This often involves a number of parallel dipole antennas with a certain spacing.", "Depending on the relative phase introduced by the network, the same combination of dipole antennas can operate as a \"broadside array\" (directional normal to a line connecting the elements) or as an \"end-fire array\" (directional along the line connecting the elements).", "Antenna arrays may employ any basic (omnidirectional or weakly directional) antenna type, such as dipole, loop or slot antennas.", "These elements are often identical.", "However a log-periodic dipole array consists of a number of dipole elements of different lengths in order to obtain a somewhat directional antenna having an extremely wide bandwidth: these are frequently used for television reception in fringe areas.", "The dipole antennas composing it are all considered \"active elements\" since they are all electrically connected together (and to the transmission line).", "On the other hand, a superficially similar dipole array, the Yagi-Uda Antenna (or simply \"Yagi\"), has only one dipole element with an electrical connection; the other so-called parasitic elements interact with the electromagnetic field in order to realize a fairly directional antenna but one which is limited to a rather narrow bandwidth.", "The Yagi antenna has similar looking parasitic dipole elements but which act differently due to their somewhat different lengths.", "There may be a number of so-called \"directors\" in front of the active element in the direction of propagation, and usually a single (but possibly more) \"reflector\" on the opposite side of the active element.", "At low frequencies (such as AM broadcast), arrays of vertical towers are used to achieve directionality  and they will occupy large areas of land.", "For reception, a long Beverage antenna can have significant directivity.", "For non directional portable use, a short vertical antenna or small loop antenna works well, with the main design challenge being that of impedance matching.", "With a vertical antenna a loading coil at the base of the antenna may be employed to cancel the reactive component of impedance; small loop antennas are tuned with parallel capacitors for this purpose.", "An antenna lead-in is the transmission line (or feed line) which connects the antenna to a transmitter or receiver.", "The antenna feed may refer to all components connecting the antenna to the transmitter or receiver, such as an impedance matching network in addition to the transmission line.", "In a so-called aperture antenna, such as a horn or parabolic dish, the \"feed\" may also refer to a basic antenna inside the entire system (normally at the focus of the parabolic dish or at the throat of a horn) which could be considered the one active element in that antenna system.", "A microwave antenna may also be fed directly from a waveguide in place of a (conductive) transmission line.", "Monopole antennas consist of a single radiating element such as a metal rod, often mounted over a conducting surface, a ground plane.", "One side of the feedline from the receiver or transmitter is connected to the rod, and the other side to the ground plane, which may be the Earth.", "The most common form is the quarter-wave monopole which is one-quarter of a wavelength long and has a gain of 5.12 dBi when mounted over a ground plane.", "Monopoles have an omnidirectional radiation pattern, so they are used for broad coverage of an area, and have vertical polarization.", "The ground waves used for broadcasting at low frequencies must be vertically polarized, so large vertical monopole antennas are used for broadcasting in the MF, LF, and VLF bands.", "Small monopoles are used as nondirectional antennas on portable radios in the HF, VHF, and UHF bands.", "The most widely used class of antenna, a dipole antenna consists of two symmetrical radiators such as metal rods or wires, with one side of the balanced feedline from the transmitter or receiver attached to each.", "A horizontal dipole radiates in two lobes perpendicular to the antenna's axis.", "A half-wave dipole the most common type, has two collinear elements each a quarter wavelength long and a gain of 2.15 dBi.", "Used individually as low gain antennas, dipoles are also used as driven elements in many more complicated higher gain types of antennas.", "A necessary condition for the aforementioned reciprocity property is that the materials in the antenna and transmission medium are linear and reciprocal.", "Reciprocal (or bilateral) means that the material has the same response to an electric current or magnetic field in one direction, as it has to the field or current in the opposite direction.", "Most materials used in antennas meet these conditions, but some microwave antennas use high-tech components such as isolators and circulators, made of nonreciprocal materials such as ferrite.", "These can be used to give the antenna a different behavior on receiving than it has on transmitting, which can be useful in applications like radar.", "Antennas are characterized by a number of performance measures which a user would be concerned with in selecting or designing an antenna for a particular application.", "Chief among these relate to the directional characteristics (as depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern) and the resulting gain.", "Even in omnidirectional (or weakly directional) antennas, the gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the horizontal directions, sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground.", "The antenna's power gain (or simply \"gain\") also takes into account the antenna's efficiency, and is often the primary figure of merit.", "Resonant antennas are expected to be used around a particular resonant frequency; an antenna must therefore be built or ordered to match the frequency range of the intended application.", "A particular antenna design will present a particular feedpoint impedance.", "While this may affect the choice of an antenna, an antenna's impedance can also be adapted to the desired impedance level of a system using a matching network while maintaining the other characteristics (except for a possible loss of efficiency).", "An antenna transmits and receives radio waves with a particular polarization which can be reoriented by tilting the axis of the antenna in many (but not all) cases.", "The physical size of an antenna is often a practical issue, particularly at lower frequencies (longer wavelengths).", "Highly directional antennas need to be significantly larger than the wavelength.", "Resonant antennas usually use a linear conductor (or element), or pair of such elements, each of which is about a quarter of the wavelength in length (an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths will also be resonant).", "Antennas that are required to be small compared to the wavelength sacrifice efficiency and cannot be very directional.", "Fortunately at higher frequencies (UHF, microwaves) trading off performance to obtain a smaller physical size is usually not required.", "The majority of antenna designs are based on the resonance principle.", "This relies on the behaviour of moving electrons, which reflect off surfaces where

arranged in front (directors) and behind (reflectors) the active element along the boom.", "The Yagi has the inherent quality that it becomes increasingly directional, and thus has higher gain, as the number of elements increases.", "However, this also makes it increasingly sensitive to changes in frequency; if the signal frequency changes, not only does the active element receive less energy directly, but all of the passive elements adding to that signal also decrease their output as well and their signals no longer reach the active element in-phase.", "It is also possible to use multiple active elements and combine them together with transmission lines to produce a similar system where the phases add up to reinforce the output.", "The antenna array and very similar reflective array antenna consist of multiple elements, often half-wave dipoles, spaced out on a plane and wired together with transmission lines with specific phase lengths to produce a single in-phase signal at the output.", "The log-periodic antenna is a more complex design that uses multiple in-line elements similar in appearance to the Yagi-Uda but using transmission lines between the elements to produce the output.", "Reflection of the original signal also occurs when it hits an extended conductive surface, in a fashion similar to a mirror.", "This effect can also be used to increase signal through the use of a reflector, normally placed behind the active element and spaced so the reflected signal reaches the element in-phase.", "Generally the reflector will remain highly reflective even if it is not solid; gaps less than 1\u204410 generally have little effect on the outcome.", "For this reason, reflectors often take the form of wire meshes or rows of passive elements, which makes them lighter

needed] This is implemented in most AM broadcast receivers, with a small ferrite loop antenna resonated by a capacitor which is varied along with the receiver tuning in order to maintain resonance over the AM broadcast band", "Antenna tuning generally refers to cancellation of any reactance seen at the antenna terminals, leaving only a resistive impedance which might or might not be exactly the desired impedance (that of the transmission line).", "Although an antenna may be designed to have a purely resistive feedpoint impedance (such as a dipole 97% of a half wavelength long) this might not be exactly true at the frequency that it is eventually used at.", "In some cases the physical length of the antenna can be \"trimmed\" to obtain a pure resistance.", "On the other hand, the addition of a series inductance or parallel capacitance can be used to cancel a residual capacitative or inductive reactance, respectively.", "Although a resonant antenna has a purely resistive feed-point impedance at a particular frequency, many (if not most) applications require using an antenna over a range of frequencies.", "An antenna's bandwidth specifies the range of frequencies over which its performance does not suffer due to a poor impedance match.", "Also in the case of a Yagi-Uda array, the use of the antenna very far away from its design frequency reduces the antenna's directivity, thus reducing the usable bandwidth regardless of impedance matching.", "Instead, it is often desired to have an antenna whose impedance does not vary so greatly over a certain bandwidth.", "It turns out that the amount of reactance seen at the terminals of a resonant antenna when the frequency is shifted, say, by 5%, depends very much on the diameter of the conductor used.", "A long thin wire used as a half-wave dipole (or quarter wave monopole) will have a reactance significantly greater than the resistive impedance it has at resonance, leading to a poor match and generally unacceptable performance.", "Making the element using a tube of a diameter perhaps 1/50 of its length, however, results in a reactance at this altered frequency which is not so great, and a much less serious mismatch which will only modestly damage the antenna's net performance.", "Thus rather thick tubes are typically used for the solid elements of such antennas, including Yagi-Uda arrays.", "Rather than just using a thick tube, there are similar techniques used to the same effect such as replacing thin wire elements with cages to simulate a thicker element.", "This widens the bandwidth of the resonance.", "On the other hand, amateur radio antennas need to operate over several bands which are widely separated from each other.", "This can often be accomplished simply by connecting resonant elements for the different bands in parallel.", "Most of the transmitter's power will flow into the resonant element while the others present a high (reactive) impedance and draw little current from the same voltage.", "A popular solution uses so-called traps consisting of parallel resonant circuits which are strategically placed in breaks along each antenna element.", "When used at one particular frequency band the trap presents a very high impedance (parallel resonance) effectively truncating the element at that length, making it a proper resonant antenna.", "At a lower frequency

there is always a maximum for \u03b8=0, horizontal propagation (left pattern).", "For horizontal polarization, there is cancellation at that angle.", "Note that the above formulae and these plots assume the ground as a perfect conductor.", "These plots of the radiation pattern correspond to a distance between the antenna and its image of 2.5\u03bb.", "As the antenna height is increased, the number of lobes increases as well.", "On the other hand, classical (analog) television transmissions are usually horizontally polarized, because in urban areas buildings can reflect the electromagnetic waves and create ghost images due to multipath propagation.", "Using horizontal polarization, ghosting is reduced because the amount of reflection of electromagnetic waves in the p polarization (horizontal polarization off the side of a building) is generally less than s (vertical, in this case) polarization.", "Vertically polarized analog television has nevertheless been used in some rural areas.", "In digital terrestrial television such reflections are less problematic, due to robustness of binary transmissions and error correction.", "Current circulating in one antenna generally induces a voltage across the feedpoint of nearby antennas or antenna elements.", "The mathematics presented below are useful in analyzing the electrical behaviour of antenna arrays, where the properties of the individual array elements (such as half wave dipoles) are already known.", "If those elements were widely separated and driven in a certain amplitude and phase, then each would act independently as that element is known to.", "However, because of the mutual interaction between their electric and magnetic fields due to proximity, the currents in each element are not simply a function of the applied voltage (according to its driving point impedance), but depend on the currents in the other nearby elements.", "Note that this now is a near field phenomenon which could not be properly accounted for using the Friis transmission equation for instance.", "This is a consequence of Lorentz reciprocity.", "For an antenna element  not connected to anything (open circuited) one can write .", "But for an element  which is short circuited, a current is generated across that short but no voltage is allowed, so the corresponding .", "This is the case, for instance, with the so-called parasitic elements of a Yagi-Uda antenna where the solid rod can be viewed as a dipole antenna shorted across its feedpoint.", "Parasitic elements are unpowered elements that absorb and reradiate RF energy according to the induced current calculated using such a system of equations.", "The difference in the above factors for the case of \u03b8=0 is the reason that most broadcasting (transmissions intended for the public) uses vertical polarization.", "For receivers near the ground, horizontally polarized transmissions suffer cancellation.", "For best reception the receiving antennas for these signals are likewise vertically polarized.", "In some applications where the receiving antenna must work in any position, as in mobile phones, the base station antennas use mixed polarization, such as linear polarization at an angle (with both vertical and horizontal components) or circular polarization.", "Loop antennas consist of a loop or coil of wire.", "Loops with circumference of a wavelength or larger act similarly to dipole antennas.", "However loops small in comparison to a wavelength act differently.", "They interact with the magnetic field of the radio wave instead of the electric field as other antennas do, and so are relatively insensitive to nearby electrical noise.", "However they have low radiation resistance, and so are inefficient for transmitting.", "They are used as receiving antennas at low frequencies, and also as direction finding antennas.", "It is a fundamental property of antennas that the electrical characteristics of an antenna described in the next section, such as gain, radiation pattern, impedance, bandwidth, resonant frequency and polarization, are the same whether the antenna is transmitting or receiving.", "For example, the \"receiving pattern\" (sensitivity as a function of direction) of an antenna when used for reception is identical to the radiation pattern of the antenna when it is driven and functions as a radiator.", "This is a consequence of the reciprocity theorem of electromagnetics.", "Therefore, in discussions of antenna properties no distinction is usually made between receiving and transmitting terminology, and the antenna can be viewed as either transmitting or receiving, whichever is more convenient."]}, {"qa": [{"answer": "Latin", "question": "What language is the word

two distinct ways to refer to two different types of linguistic phenomena.", "One usage\u2014the more common among linguists\u2014refers to a variety of a language that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.", "The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class.", "A dialect that is associated with a particular social class can be termed a sociolect, a dialect that is associated with a particular ethnic group can be termed as ethnolect, and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect.", "According to this definition, any variety of a language constitutes \"a dialect\", including any standard varieties.", "The other usage refers to a language that is socially subordinated to a regional or national standard language, often historically cognate or related to the standard language, but not actually derived from it.", "In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a \"dialect,\" as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of social or political status, official status, predominance or prevalence, or all of the above.", "Meanwhile, the \"dialects\" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often related) languages in and of themselves.", "For example, most of the various regional Romance languages of Italy, often colloquially referred to as Italian \"dialects,\" are, in fact, not actually derived from modern standard Italian, but rather evolved from Vulgar Latin separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now Italy.", "These various Latin-derived regional languages are therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly \"dialects\" of the standard Italian language, but are instead better defined as their own separate languages.", "Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, various regional versions or varieties of standard Italian developed, generally as a mix of the national standard Italian with local regional languages and local accents.", "These variations on standard Italian, known as regional Italian, would more appropriately be called \"dialects\" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of \"dialect,\" as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.", "A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation (phonology, including prosody).", "Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term accent may be preferred over dialect.", "Other types of speech varieties include jargons, which are characterized by differences in lexicon (vocabulary); slang; patois; pidgins; and argots.", "A standard dialect (also known as a standardized dialect or \"standard language\") is a dialect that is supported by institutions.", "Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the \"correct\" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.).", "There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language.", "For example, Standard American English, Standard British English, Standard Canadian English, Standard Indian English, Standard Australian English, and Standard Philippine English may all be said to be standard dialects of the English language.", "A nonstandard dialect, like a standard dialect, has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support.", "Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are Southern American English, Western Australian English, Scouse and Tyke.", "The Dialect Test was designed by Joseph Wright to compare different English dialects with each other.", "There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language.", "A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results.", "The distinction is therefore subjective and depends on the user's frame of reference.", "For example, there is discussion about if the Lim\u00f3n Creole English must be considered as \"a kind\" of English or a different language.", "This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendant of Jamaican people.", "The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends on the University they belong.", "The most common, and most purely linguistic, criterion is that of mutual intelligibility: two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages.", "However, this definition becomes problematic in the case of dialect continua, in which it may be the case that dialect B is mutually intelligible with both dialect A and dialect C but dialects A and C are not mutually intelligible with each other.", "In this case the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether A and C are dialects of the same language or not.", "Cases may also arise in which a speaker of dialect X can understand a speaker of dialect Y, but not vice versa; the mutual intelligibility criterion flounders here as well.", "Another occasionally used criterion for discriminating dialects from languages is that of linguistic authority, a more sociolinguistic notion.", "According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language.", "For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of Bavarian German and East Franconian German might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.", "By way of contrast, although Yiddish is classified by linguists as a language in the \"Middle High German\" group of languages, a Yiddish speaker would not consult a German dictionary to determine the word to use in such a case.", "By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a \"dialect\" of some language\u2014\"everybody speaks a dialect\".", "According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the same language or dialects of different languages.", "A framework was developed in 1967 by Heinz Kloss, abstand and ausbau languages, to describe speech communities, that while unified politically and/or culturally, include multiple dialects which though closely related genetically may be divergent to the point of inter-dialect unintelligibility.", "The terms \"language\" and \"dialect\" are not necessarily mutually exclusive: There is nothing contradictory in the statement \"the language of the Pennsylvania Dutch is a dialect of German\".", "There are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language.", "Perhaps the most common is \"variety\"; \"lect\" is another.", "A more general term is \"languoid\", which does not distinguish between dialects, languages, and groups of languages, whether genealogically related or not.", "In many societies, however, a particular dialect, often the sociolect of the elite class, comes to be identified as the \"standard\" or \"proper\" version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction, and is contrasted with other varieties.", "As a result of this, in some contexts the term \"dialect\" refers specifically to varieties with low social status.", "In this secondary sense of \"dialect\", language varieties are often called dialects rather than languages:", "The status of \"language\" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development.", "Romansh came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects.", "An opposite example is the case of Chinese, whose variations such as Mandarin and Cantonese are often called dialects and not languages, despite their mutual unintelligibility.", "Modern Nationalism, as developed especially since the French Revolution, has made the distinction between \"language\" and \"dialect\" an issue of great political importance.", "A group speaking a separate \"language\" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate \"people\", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a \"dialect\" tends to be seen not as \"a people\" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.", "[citation needed] The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy, or even armed conflict.", "The Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich published the expression, A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot (\"\u05d0\u05b7

any attempt at answering the question \"what is a language?\"", "is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible.", "This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.", "When talking about the German language, the term German dialects is only used for the traditional regional varieties.", "That allows them to be distinguished from the regional varieties of modern standard German.", "The German dialects show a wide spectrum of variation.", "Most of them are not mutually intelligible.", "German dialectology traditionally names the major dialect groups after Germanic tribes from which they were assumed to have descended.", "[citation needed]", "The extent to which the dialects are spoken varies according to a number of factors: In Northern Germany, dialects are less common than in the South.", "In cities, dialects are less common than on the countryside.", "In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment.", "The situation in Switzerland and Liechtenstein is different from the rest of the German-speaking countries.", "The Swiss German dialects are the default everyday language in virtually every situation, whereas standard German is seldom spoken.", "Some Swiss German speakers perceive standard German to be a foreign language.", "The Low German varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects.", "This reflects the modern situation where they are roofed by standard German.", "This is different from the situation in the Middle Ages when Low German had strong tendencies towards an ausbau language.", "Italy is home to a vast array of native regional minority languages, most of which are Romance-based and have their own local variants.", "These regional languages are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian \"dialects,\" or dialetti (standard Italian for \"dialects\").", "However, the majority of the regional languages in Italy are in fact not actually \"dialects\" of standard Italian in the strict linguistic sense, as they are not derived from modern standard Italian but instead evolved locally from Vulgar Latin independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as \"standard Italian.\"", "They are therefore better classified as individual languages rather than \"dialects.\"", "In addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another and with distinct individual histories, the Latin-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true \"dialects\" due to the often high degree in which they lack mutual intelligibility.", "Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutual unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible.", "For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant.", "Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan, Catalan, or French speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker.", "Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have an greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related Neapolitan language, but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the same island as the Sicilian language.", "Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived Florentine Tuscan language.", "The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the 12th century, and it first became widely known in Italy through the works of authors such as Dante Alighieri, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, and Petrarch.", "Dante's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus became the language of the literate and upper class in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula as the lingua franca among the Italian educated class as well as Italian traveling merchants.", "The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of Tuscany in the Late Middle Ages and the Renaissance further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.", "During the Risorgimento, proponents of Italian republicanism and Italian nationalism, such as Alessandro Manzoni, stressed the importance of establishing a uniform national language in order to better create an Italian national identity.", "With the unification of Italy in the 1860s, standard Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state, while the various unofficial regional languages of Italy gradually became regarded as subordinate \"dialects\" to Italian, increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism.", "However, at the time of the Italian Unification, standard Italian still existed mainly as a literary language, and only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak standard Italian.", "In the early 20th century, the vast conscription of Italian men from all throughout Italy during World War I is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard Italian among less educated Italian men, as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military.", "With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of public education, Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian, while literacy rates among all social classes improved.", "Today, the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region.", "However, to some Italians, speaking a regional language, especially in a formal setting or outside of one's region, may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class, uneducated, boorish, or overly informal.", "Italians in different regions today may also speak regional varieties of standard Italian, or regional Italian dialects, which, unlike the majority of languages of Italy, are actually dialects of standard Italian rather than separate languages.", "A regional Italian dialect is generally standard Italian that has been heavily influenced or mixed with local or regional native languages and accents.", "The languages of Italy are primarily Latin-based Romance languages, with the most widely spoken languages falling within the Italo-Dalmatian language family.", "This wide category includes:", "The Sardinian language is considered to be its own Romance language family, separate not only from standard Italian but also the wider Italo-Dalmatian family, and it includes the Campidanese Sardinian and Logudorese Sardinian variants.", "However, Gallurese, Sassarese, and Corsican are also spoken in Sardinia, and these languages are considered closely related or derived from the Italian Tuscan language and thus are Italo-Dalmatian languages.", "Furthermore, the Gallo-Romance language of Ligurian and the Catalan Algherese dialect are also spoken in Sardinia.", "The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent.", "English and Serbo-Croatian illustrate the point.", "English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants (British and American English, and Serbian and Croatian, respectively), along with numerous other varieties.", "For political reasons, analyzing these varieties as \"languages\" or \"dialects\" yields inconsistent results: British and American English, spoken by close political and military allies, are almost universally regarded as dialects of a single language, whereas the standard languages of Serbia and Croatia, which differ from each other to a similar extent as the dialects of English, are being treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages, largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies.", "(The Serbo-Croatian language article deals with this topic much more fully.)", "Similar examples abound.", "Macedonian, although mutually intelligible with Bulgarian, certain dialects of Serbian and to a lesser extent the rest of the South Slavic dialect continuum, is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view and the view in the Republic of Macedonia, which regards it as a language in its own right.", "Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.", "In Lebanon, a part of the Christian population considers \"Lebanese\" to be in some sense a distinct language from Arabic and not merely a dialect.", "During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the Latin script to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic.", "All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.", "In Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the Darijas (spoken North African languages) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects.", "Officially, North African countries prefer to give preference to the Literary Arabic and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to Islam), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the liturgical language of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the Qur'an.", "Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries.", "Examples of cultural elements where Darijas' use became dominant include: theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social media, folk-tale books and companies' names.", "In the 19th century, the Tsarist Government of the Russian Empire claimed that Ukrainian was merely a dialect of Russian and not a language on its own.", "The differences were few and caused by the conquest of western Ukraine by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.", "However, the dialects in Ukraine eventually differed substantially from the dialects in Russia.", "The German Empire conquered Ukraine during World War I and was planning on either annexing it or installing a puppet king, but was defeated by the Entente, with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks.", "After conquering the rest of Ukraine from the Whites, Ukraine joined the USSR and was enlarged (gaining Crimea and then Eastern Galicia), whence a process of Ukrainization was begun, with encouragement from Moscow.", "After World War II, due to Ukrainian collaborationism with the Axis powers in an attempt to gain independence, Moscow changed its policy towards repression of the Ukrainian language.", "Today the boundaries of the Ukrainian language to the Russian language are still not drawn clearly, with an intermediate dialect between them, called Surzhyk, developing in Ukraine.", "There have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes.", "One example is Moldovan.", "In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of \"Romanian expansionism\", rejected a proposal from President Mircea Snegur to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a Moldovan\u2013Romanian dictionary was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages.", "Linguists of the Romanian Academy reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova, Ion B\u0103rbu\u0163\u0103, described the dictionary as a politically motivated \"absurdity\".", "Unlike most languages that use alphabets to indicate the pronunciation, Chinese characters have developed from logograms that do not always give hints to its pronunciation.", "Although the written characters remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions has developed to an extent that the varieties of the spoken language are often mutually unintelligible.", "As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including Xiang, Wu, Gan, Min, Yue (Cantonese), and Hakka often show traces of Old Chinese or Middle Chinese.", "From the Ming dynasty onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties.", "With the founding of the Republic of China, Standard Mandarin was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing.", "Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as fangyan (dialects).", "Cantonese is still the most commonly used language in Hong Kong, Macau and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas Southern Min has been accepted in Taiwan as an important local language along with Mandarin.", "Many historical linguists view any speech form as a dialect of the older medium of communication from which it developed.", "[citation needed] This point of view sees the modern Romance languages as dialects of Latin, modern Greek as a dialect of Ancient Greek, Tok Pisin as a dialect of English, and North Germanic as dialects of Old Norse.", "This paradigm is not entirely problem-free.", "It sees genetic relationships as paramount: the \"dialects\" of a \"language\" (which itself may be a \"dialect\" of a yet older language) may or may not be mutually intelligible.", "Moreover, a parent language may spawn several \"dialects\" which themselves subdivide any number of times, with some \"branches\" of the tree changing more rapidly than others.", "This can give rise to the situation in which two dialects (defined according to this paradigm) with a somewhat distant genetic relationship are mutually more readily comprehensible than more closely related dialects.", "In one opinion, this pattern is clearly present among the modern Romance languages, with Italian and Spanish having a high degree of mutual comprehensibility, which neither language shares with French, despite some claiming that both languages are genetically closer to French than to each other:[citation needed] In fact, French-Italian and French-Spanish relative mutual incomprehensibility is due to French having undergone more rapid and more pervasive phonological change than have Spanish and Italian, not to real or imagined distance in genetic relationship.", "In fact, Italian and French share many more root words in common that do not even appear in Spanish.", "For example, the Italian and French words for various foods, some family relationships, and body parts are very similar to each other, yet most of those words are completely different in Spanish.", "Italian \"avere\" and \"essere\" as auxiliaries for forming compound tenses are used similarly to French \"avoir\" and \"\u00eatre\".", "Spanish only retains \"haber\" and has done away with \"ser\" in forming compound tenses.", "However, when it comes to phonological structures, Italian and Spanish have undergone less change than French, with the result that some native speakers of Italian and Spanish may attain a degree of mutual comprehension that permits extensive communication.", "[citation needed]", "One language, Interlingua, was developed so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.", "Drawing from such concepts as the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European, linguists[who?]", "developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.", "[citation needed] Researchers at the International Auxiliary Language Association extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.", "In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects.", "This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English.", "Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages.", "In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.", "It should be noted,

War.", "Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly from as far away as Mexico.", "By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage.", "Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, \"coloured\" (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority.", "Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic.", "Most of those

"The majority of blacks in Bermuda can be termed \"Bermudian blacks\", whose ancestry dates back centuries between the 17th century and the end of slavery in 1834, Bermuda's black population was self-sustaining, with its growth resulting largely from natural expansion.", "This contrasts to the enslaved blacks of the plantation colonies, who were subjected to conditions so harsh as to drop their birth rate below the death rate, and slaveholders in the United States and the West Indies found it necessary to continue importing more enslaved blacks from Africa until the end of slavery (the same had been true for the Native Americans that the Africans had replaced on the New World plantations).", "The indigenous populations of many West Indian islands, and much of the South-East of what is now the United States that had survived the 16th- and 17th-century epidemics of European-introduced diseases then became the victims of large-scale slave raiding, with much of the region completely depopulated.", "When the supply of indigenous slaves ran out, the slaveholders looked to Africa).", "The ancestry of Bermuda's black population is distinguished from that of the British West Indian black population in two ways: firstly, the higher degree of European and Native American admixture; secondly, the source of the African ancestry.", "In the British West Indian islands (and also in the United States), the majority of enslaved blacks brought across the Atlantic came from West Africa (roughly between modern Senegal and Ghana).", "Very little of Bermuda's original black emigration came from this area.", "The first blacks to arrive in Bermuda in any numbers were free blacks from Spanish-speaking areas of the West Indies, and most of the remainder were recently enslaved Africans captured from the Spanish and Portuguese.", "As Spain and Portugal sourced most of their slaves from South-West Africa (the Portuguese through ports in modern-day Angola; the Spanish purchased most of their African slaves from Portuguese traders, and from Arabs whose slave trading was centred in Zanzibar).", "Genetic studies have consequently shown that the African ancestry of black Bermudians (other than those resulting from recent immigration from the British West Indian islands) is largely from the a band across southern Africa, from Angola to Mozambique, which is similar to what is

Barcelona have elected the club president.", "The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship.", "The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch.", "His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as N\u00fa\u00f1ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as Maradona, Rom\u00e1rio and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands.", "The departures of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Lu\u00eds Figo, then club vice-captain.", "Figo had become a cult hero, and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own.", "However, Barcelona fans were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception.", "Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.", "The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went.", "van Gaal was replaced by Lloren\u00e7 Serra Ferrer who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a humiliating first-round Champions League exit, and was eventually dismissed late in the season.", "Long-serving coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season.", "Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Louis van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager.", "What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003.", "This led to van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Anti\u0107, though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage.", "At the end of the season, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president Joan Gaspart resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.", "Two days later, it was announced that Luis Enrique would return to Barcelona as head coach, after he agreed to a two-year deal.", "He was recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, his former national teammate.", "Following Enrique's arrival, Barcelona broke their transfer record when they paid Liverpool F.C. between \u20ac81 to \u20ac94 million for striker Luis Su\u00e1rez, who was

Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.", "The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003\u201304 season to 170,000 in September 2009, the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.", "During the 1950s the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.", "The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup, with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee.", "In 2002, the European encounter between

uniquely to the churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English churches that bore that name and English political groups that formed during the English Civil War.", "Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ.", "Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707 which created the kingdom of Great Britain.", "In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants.", "The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there are a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism.", "Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).", "The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the European Reformation of the 16th century; the example of John Calvin's Geneva being particularly influential.", "Most Reformed churches which trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government.", "In the twentieth century, some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement, including the World Council of Churches.", "Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches.", "Some Presbyterian churches have entered into unions with other churches, such as Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists.", "Presbyterians in the United States came largely from Scotch-Irish immigrants communities, and also from New England Yankee communities that had originally been Congregational but changed because of an agreed-upon \"Plan of Union of 1801\" for frontier areas.", "Presbyterian history is part of the history of Christianity, but the beginning of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement occurred during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation.", "As the Catholic Church resisted the reformers, several different theological movements splintered from the Church and bore different denominations.", "Presbyterianism was especially influenced by the French theologian John Calvin, who is credited with the development of Reformed theology, and the work of John Knox, a Scotsman who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland and brought his teachings back to Scotland.", "The Presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to England and Scotland.", "In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland adopted the Scots Confession as the creed of the Scottish Kingdom.", "In December 1560, the First Book of Discipline was published, outlining important doctrinal issues but also establishing regulations for church government, including the creation of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed superintendents which later became known as presbyteries.", "Presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organization (or \"church order\") and worship; often using a \"Book of Order\" to regulate common practice and order.", "The origins of the Presbyterian churches are in Calvinism.", "Many branches of Presbyterianism are remnants of previous splits from larger groups.", "Some of the splits have been due to doctrinal controversy, while some have been caused by disagreement concerning the degree to which those ordained to church office should be required to agree with the Westminster Confession of Faith, which historically serves as an important confessional document \u2013 second only to the Bible, yet directing particularities in the standardization and translation of the Bible \u2013 in Presbyterian churches.", "Presbyterians place great importance upon education and lifelong learning.", "Continuous study of the scriptures, theological writings, and understanding and interpretation of church doctrine are embodied in several statements of faith and catechisms formally adopted by various branches of the church, often referred to as \"subordinate standards\".", "It is generally considered that the point of such learning is to enable one to put one's faith into practice; some Presbyterians generally exhibit their faith in action as well as words, by generosity, hospitality, as well as proclaiming the gospel of Christ.", "Presbyterian government is by councils (known as courts) of elders.", "Teaching and ruling

historically a confessional tradition.", "This has two implications.", "The obvious one is that confessional churches express their faith in the form of \"confessions of faith,\" which have some level of authoritative status.", "However this is based on a more subtle point: In confessional churches, theology is not solely an individual matter.", "While individuals are encouraged to understand Scripture, and may challenge the current institutional understanding, theology is carried out by the community as a whole.", "It is this community understanding of theology that is expressed in confessions.", "Some Presbyterian traditions adopt only the Westminster Confession of Faith as the doctrinal standard to which teaching elders are required to subscribe, in contrast to the Larger and Shorter catechisms, which are approved for use in instruction.", "Many Presbyterian denominations, especially in North America, have adopted all of the Westminster Standards as their standard of doctrine which is subordinate to the Bible.", "These documents are Calvinistic in their doctrinal orientation.", "The Presbyterian Church in Canada retains the Westminster Confession of Faith in its

of Scotland\" but \"with due regard to liberty of opinion in points which do not enter into the substance of the Faith\" (V).", "This formulation represents many years of struggle over the extent to

the Free Church of Scotland, have no such \"conscience clause\".", "The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has adopted the Book of Confessions, which reflects the inclusion of other Reformed confessions in addition to the Westminster Standards.", "These other documents include ancient creedal statements (the Nicene Creed, the Apostles' Creed), 16th-century Reformed confessions (the Scots Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic Confession), and 20th century documents (The Theological Declaration of Barmen, Confession of 1967 and A Brief Statement of Faith).", "Presbyterian

Knox.", "It was enacted as law by the Scottish Parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of Presbyterian church legislation elsewhere.", "Over subsequent centuries, many Presbyterian churches modified these prescriptions by introducing hymnody, instrumental accompaniment, and ceremonial vestments into worship.", "However, there is not one fixed \"Presbyterian\" worship style.",

approximating the practices of Lutheranism or Anglicanism (especially where Scottish tradition is esteemed),[clarification needed] or semi-formal, allowing for a balance of hymns, preaching, and congregational participation (favored by probably most American Presbyterians).", "Most Presbyterian churches follow the traditional liturgical year and observe the traditional holidays, holy seasons, such as Advent, Christmas, Ash Wednesday, Holy Week, Easter, Pentecost, etc.", "They also make use of the appropriate seasonal liturgical colors, etc.", "Many, incorporate ancient liturgical prayers and responses into the communion services and follow a daily, seasonal, and festival lectionary.", "Other Presbyterians, however, such as the Reformed Presbyterians, would practice a cappella exclusive psalmody, as well as eschew the celebration of holy days.", "Among the paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, in which some Presbyterians are involved, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown to such vestments as the alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite), which some, particularly those identifying with the Liturgical Renewal Movement, hold to be more ancient and representative of a more ecumenical past.", "Early Presbyterians were careful to distinguish between the \"church,\" which referred the members, and the \"meeting house,\" which was the building in which the church met.", "Until the late 19th century, very few Presbyterians ever referred to their buildings as \"churches.\"", "Presbyterians believed that meeting-houses (now called churches) are buildings to support the worship of God.", "The decor in some instances was austere so as not to detract from worship.", "Early Presbyterian meeting-houses were extremely plain.", "No stained glass, no elaborate furnishings, and no images were to be found in the meeting-house.", "The pulpit, often raised so as only to be accessible by a staircase, was the centerpiece of the building.", "Usually a

area.", "The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians.", "In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel.", "By using the \"empty\" cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and

significant use of symbolism.", "You may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible.", "Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or

the church.", "However, with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Church of Scotland was finally unequivocally recognised as a Presbyterian institution by the monarch due to Scottish Presbyterian support for the aforementioned revolution and the Acts of Union 1707 between Scotland and England guaranteed the Church of Scotland's form of government.", "However, legislation by the United Kingdom

and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures.", "Because glass can be formed or molded into any shape, and also because it is a sterile product, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses.", "In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads.", "When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an organic polymer plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass.", "Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and reading glasses.", "Most common glass contains other ingredients to change its properties.", "Lead glass or flint glass is more 'brilliant' because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion.", "Adding barium also increases the refractive index.", "Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and low dispersion and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity has been replaced by lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses.", "[citation needed] Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared energy, for example in heat absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs UV wavelengths.", "Fused quartz is a glass made from chemically-pure SiO2 (silica).", "It has excellent thermal shock characteristics, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot.", "However, its high melting-temperature (1723 \u00b0C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with.", "Normally, other substances are added to simplify processing.", "One is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3, \"soda\"), which lowers the glass transition temperature.", "The soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable, so lime (calcium oxide [CaO], generally obtained from limestone), some magnesium oxide (MgO) and aluminium oxide

glass can be made from pure silica, but the high melting point and very narrow glass transition of quartz make glassblowing and hot working difficult.", "In glasses like soda lime, the compounds added to quartz are used to lower the melting temperature and improve workability, at a cost in the toughness, thermal stability, and optical transmittance.", "Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light.", "In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light.", "The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection.", "Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material.", "The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface.", "These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing\u2014i.e., colored.", "Naturally occurring glass, especially the volcanic glass obsidian, has been used by many Stone Age societies across the globe

ions (or color centers) that are homogeneously distributed, and by precipitation of finely dispersed particles (such as in photochromic glasses).", "Ordinary soda-lime glass appears colorless to the naked eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments.", "Further FeO

Saint Denis.", "By the 14th-century, architects were designing buildings with walls of stained glass such as Sainte-Chapelle, Paris, (1203\u20131248) and the East end of Gloucester Cathedral.", "Stained glass had a major revival with Gothic Revival architecture in the 19th-century.", "With the Renaissance, and a change in architectural style, the use of large stained glass windows became less prevalent.", "The use of domestic stained glass increased until most substantial houses had glass windows.", "These were initially small panes leaded together, but with the changes in technology, glass could be manufactured relatively cheaply in increasingly larger sheets.", "This led to larger window panes, and, in the 20th-century, to much larger windows in ordinary domestic and commercial buildings.", "In the 20th century, new types of glass such as laminated glass, reinforced glass and glass bricks have increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass.", "Multi-storey buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass.", "Similarly, laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens.",

lowers melting point, lowers viscosity of the melt, and increases refractive index.", "Lead oxide also facilitates solubility of other metal oxides and is used in colored glasses.", "The viscosity decrease of lead glass melt is very significant (roughly 100 times in comparison with soda glasses); this allows easier removal of bubbles and working at lower temperatures, hence its frequent use as an additive in vitreous enamels and glass solders.", "The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have

intermediates (titanium, aluminium, zirconium, beryllium, magnesium, zinc) can act as both network formers and modifiers, according to the glass composition.", "The modifiers (calcium, lead, lithium, sodium, potassium) alter the network structure; they are usually present as ions, compensated by nearby non-bridging oxygen atoms, bound by one covalent bond to the glass network and holding one

metal ions are small and mobile; their presence in glass allows a degree of electrical conductivity, especially in molten state or at high temperature.", "Their mobility decreases the chemical resistance of the glass, allowing leaching by water and facilitating corrosion.", "Alkaline earth ions, with their two positive charges and requirement for two non-bridging oxygen ions to compensate for their charge, are much less mobile themselves and also hinder diffusion of other ions, especially the alkalis.", "The most common commercial glasses contain both alkali and alkaline earth ions

surface by reaction with e.g. sulfur or fluorine compounds.", "Presence of alkaline metal ions has also detrimental effect to the loss tangent of the glass, and to its electrical resistance; glasses

159}], "sentences": ["In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked).", "Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption.", "Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory.", "Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material (detritus)).", "All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems.", "It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors.", "For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died.", "The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population.", "On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \"donor\" organism(s).", "Classification of predators by the extent to which they feed on and interact with their prey is one way ecologists may wish to categorize the different types of predation.", "Instead of focusing on what they eat, this system classifies predators by the way in which they eat, and the general nature of the interaction between predator and prey species.", "Two factors are considered here: How close the predator and prey are (in the latter two cases the term prey may be replaced with host) and whether or not the prey are directly murdered by the predator is considered, with true predation and parasitoidism involving certain death.", "A true predator can commonly be known as one that kills and eats another living thing.", "Whereas other types of predator all harm their prey in some way, this form kills them.", "Predators may hunt actively for prey in pursuit predation, or sit and wait for prey to approach within striking distance, as in ambush predators.", "Some predators kill large prey and dismember or chew it prior to eating it, such as a jaguar or a human; others may eat their (usually much smaller) prey whole, as does a bottlenose dolphin swallowing a fish, or a snake, duck or stork swallowing a frog.", "Some animals that kill both large and small prey for their size (domestic cats and dogs are prime examples) may do either depending upon the circumstances; either would devour a large insect whole but dismember a rabbit.", "Some predation entails venom that subdues a prey creature before the predator ingests the prey by killing, which the box jellyfish does, or disabling it, found in the behavior of the cone shell.", "In some cases, the venom, as in rattlesnakes and some spiders, contributes to the digestion of the prey item even before the predator begins eating.", "In other cases, the prey organism may die in the mouth or digestive system of the predator.", "Baleen whales, for example, eat millions of microscopic plankton at once, the prey being broken down well after entering the whale.", "Seed predation and egg predation are other forms of true predation, as seeds and eggs represent potential organisms.", "Predators of this classification need not eat prey entirely.", "For example, some predators cannot digest bones, while others can.", "Some may eat only part of an organism, as in grazing (see below), but still consistently cause its direct death.", "Grazing organisms may also kill their prey species, but this is seldom the case.", "While some herbivores like zooplankton live on unicellular phytoplankton and therefore, by the individualized nature of the organism, kill their prey, many only eat a small part of the plant.", "Grazing livestock may pull some grass out at the roots, but most is simply grazed upon, allowing the plant to regrow once again.", "Kelp is frequently grazed in subtidal kelp forests, but regrows at the base of the blade continuously to cope with browsing pressure.", "Animals may also be 'grazed' upon; female mosquitos land on hosts briefly to gain sufficient proteins for the development of their offspring.", "Starfish may be grazed on, being capable of regenerating lost arms.", "Parasites can at times be difficult to distinguish from grazers.", "Their feeding behavior is similar in many ways, however they are noted for their close association with their host species.", "While a grazing species such as an elephant may travel many kilometers in a single day, grazing on many plants in the process, parasites form very close associations with their hosts, usually having only one or at most a few in their lifetime.", "This close living arrangement may be described by the term symbiosis, \"living together\", but unlike mutualism the association significantly reduces the fitness of the host.", "Parasitic organisms range from the macroscopic mistletoe, a parasitic plant, to microscopic internal parasites such as cholera.", "Some species however have more loose associations with their hosts.", "Lepidoptera (butterfly and moth) larvae may feed parasitically on only a single plant, or they may graze on several nearby plants.", "It is therefore wise to treat this classification system as a continuum rather than four isolated forms.", "Parasitoids are organisms living in or on their host and feeding directly upon it, eventually leading to its death.", "They are much like parasites in their close symbiotic relationship with their host or hosts.", "Like the previous two classifications parasitoid predators do not kill their hosts instantly.", "However, unlike parasites, they are very similar to true predators in that the fate of their prey is quite inevitably death.", "A well-known example of a parasitoids are the ichneumon wasps, solitary insects living a free life as an adult, then laying eggs on or in another species such as a caterpillar.", "Its larva(e) feed on the growing host causing it little harm at first, but soon devouring the internal organs until finally destroying the nervous system resulting in prey death.", "By this stage the young wasp(s) are developed sufficiently to move to the next stage in their life cycle.", "Though limited mainly to the insect order Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera parasitoids make up as much as 10% of all insect species.", "Among predators there is a large degree of specialization.", "Many predators specialize in hunting only one species of prey.", "Others are more opportunistic and will kill and eat almost anything (examples: humans, leopards, dogs and alligators).", "The specialists are usually particularly well suited to capturing their preferred prey.", "The prey in turn, are often equally suited to escape that predator.", "This is called an evolutionary arms race and tends to keep the populations of both species in equilibrium.", "Some predators specialize in certain classes of prey, not just single species.", "Some will switch to other prey (with varying degrees of success) when the preferred target is extremely scarce, and they may also resort to scavenging or a herbivorous diet if possible.", "[citation needed]", "Predators are often another organism's prey, and likewise prey are often predators.", "Though blue jays prey on insects, they may in turn be prey for cats and snakes, and snakes may be the prey of hawks.", "One way of classifying predators is by trophic level.", "Organisms that feed on autotrophs, the producers of the trophic pyramid, are known as herbivores or primary consumers; those that feed on heterotrophs such as animals are known as secondary consumers.", "Secondary consumers are a type of carnivore, but there are also tertiary consumers eating these carnivores, quartary consumers eating them, and so forth.", "Because only a fraction of energy is passed on to the next level, this hierarchy of predation must end somewhere, and very seldom goes higher than five or six levels, and may go only as high as three trophic levels (for example, a lion that preys upon large herbivores such as wildebeest, which in turn eat grasses).", "A predator at the top of any food chain (that is, one that is preyed upon by no organism) is called an apex predator; examples include the orca, sperm whale, anaconda, Komodo dragon, tiger, lion, tiger shark, Nile crocodile, and most eagles and owls\u2014and even omnivorous humans and grizzly bears.", "An apex predator in one environment may not retain this position as a top predator if introduced to another habitat, such as a dog among alligators, a skunk in the presence of the great horned owl immune to skunk spray, or a snapping turtle among jaguars; a predatory species introduced into an area where it faces no predators, such as a domestic cat or a dog in some insular environments, can become an apex predator by default.", "Many organisms (of which humans are prime examples) eat from multiple levels of the food chain and, thus, make this classification problematic.", "A carnivore may eat both secondary and tertiary consumers, and its prey may itself be difficult to classify for similar reasons.", "Organisms showing both carnivory and herbivory are known as omnivores.", "Even herbivores such as the giant panda may supplement their diet with meat.", "Scavenging of carrion provides a significant part of the diet of some of the most fearsome predators.", "Carnivorous plants would be very difficult to fit into this classification, producing their own food but also digesting anything that they may trap.", "Organisms that eat detritivores or parasites would also be difficult to classify by such a scheme.", "An alternative view offered by Richard Dawkins is of predation as a form of competition: the genes of both the predator and prey are competing for the body (or 'survival machine') of the prey organism.", "This is best understood in the context of the gene centered view of evolution.", "Another manner in which predation and competition are connected is throughout intraguild predation.", "Intraguild predators are those that kill and eat other predators of different species at the same trophic level, and thus that are potential competitors.", "Predators may increase the biodiversity of communities by preventing a single species from becoming dominant.", "Such predators are known as keystone species and may have a profound influence on the balance of organisms in a particular ecosystem.", "Introduction or removal of this predator, or changes in its population density, can have drastic cascading effects on the equilibrium of many other populations in the ecosystem.", "For example, grazers of a grassland may prevent a single dominant species from taking over.", "The elimination of wolves from Yellowstone National Park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid.", "Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations.", "In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon.", "The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing.", "Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order.", "Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place.", "The act of predation can be broken down into a maximum of four stages: Detection of prey, attack, capture and finally consumption.", "The relationship between predator and prey is one that is typically beneficial to the predator, and detrimental to the prey species.", "Sometimes, however, predation has indirect benefits to the prey species, though the individuals preyed upon themselves do not benefit.", "This means that, at each applicable stage, predator and prey species are in an evolutionary arms race to maximize their respective abilities to obtain food or avoid being eaten.", "This interaction has resulted in a vast array of adaptations in both groups.", "One adaptation helping both predators and prey avoid detection is camouflage, a form of crypsis where species have an appearance that helps them blend into the background.", "Camouflage consists of not only color but also shape and pattern.", "The background upon which the organism is seen can be both its environment (e.g., the praying mantis to the right resembling dead leaves) or other organisms (e.g., zebras' stripes blend in with each other in a herd, making it difficult for lions to focus on a single target).", "The more convincing camouflage is, the more likely it is that the organism will go unseen.", "Mimicry is a related phenomenon where an organism has a similar appearance to another species.", "One such example is the drone fly, which looks a lot like a bee, yet is completely harmless as it cannot sting at all.", "Another example of batesian mimicry is the io moth, (Automeris io), which has markings on its wings that resemble an owl's eyes.", "When an insectivorous predator disturbs the moth, it reveals its hind wings, temporarily startling the predator and giving it time to escape.", "Predators may also use mimicry to lure their prey, however.", "Female fireflies of the genus Photuris, for example, copy the light signals of other species, thereby attracting male fireflies, which are then captured and eaten (see aggressive mimicry).", "While successful predation results in a gain of energy, hunting invariably involves energetic costs as well.", "When hunger is not an issue, in general most predators will not seek to attack prey since the costs outweigh the benefits.", "For instance, a large predatory fish like a shark that is well fed in an aquarium will typically ignore the smaller fish swimming around it (while the prey fish take advantage of the fact that the apex predator is apparently uninterested).", "Surplus killing represents a deviation from this type of behaviour.", "The treatment of consumption in terms of cost-benefit analysis is known as optimal foraging theory, and has been quite successful in the study of animal behavior.", "In general, costs and benefits are considered in energy gain per unit time, though other factors are also important, such as essential nutrients that have no caloric value but are necessary for survival and health.", "Social predation offers the possibility of predators to kill creatures larger than those that members of the species could overpower singly.", "Lions, hyenas, wolves, dholes, African wild dogs, and piranhas can kill large herbivores that single animals of the same species usually don't dispatch.", "Social predation allows some animals to organize hunts of creatures that would easily escape a single predator; thus chimpanzees can prey upon colobus monkeys, and Harris's hawks can cut off all possible escapes for a doomed rabbit.", "Extreme specialization of roles is evident in some hunting that requires co-operation between predators of very different species: humans with the aid of falcons or dogs, or fishing with cormorants.", "Social predation is often very complex behavior, and not all social creatures (for example, domestic cats) perform it.", "Even without complex intelligence but instinct alone, some ant species can destroy much larger creatures.", "It has been observed that well-fed predator animals in a lax captivity (for instance, pet or farm animals) will usually differentiate between putative prey animals who are familiar co-inhabitants in the same human area from wild ones outside the area.", "This interaction can range from peaceful coexistence to close companionship; motivation to ignore the predatory instinct may result from mutual advantage or fear of reprisal from human masters who have made clear that harming co-inhabitants will not be tolerated.", "Pet cats and pet mice, for example, may live together in the same human residence without incident as companions.", "Pet cats and pet dogs under human mastership often depend on each other for warmth, companionship, and even protection, particularly in rural areas.", "Predatory animals often use their usual methods of attacking prey to inflict or to threaten grievous injury to their own predators.", "The electric eel uses the same electric current to kill prey and to defend itself against animals (anacondas, caimans, egrets, jaguars, mountain lions, giant otters, humans, dogs, and cats) that ordinarily prey upon fish similar to an electric eel in size; the electric eel thus remains an apex predator in a predator-rich environment.", "A predator small enough to be prey for others, the domestic cat uses its formidable teeth and claws as weapons against animals that might confuse a cat with easier prey.", "Many non-predatory prey animals, such as a zebra, can give a strong kick that can maim or kill, while others charge with tusks or horns.", "Mobbing can be an interspecies activity: it is common for birds to respond to mobbing calls of a different species.", "Many birds will show up at the sight of mobbing and watch and call, but not participate.", "It should also be noted that some species can be on both ends of a mobbing attack.", "Crows are frequently mobbed by smaller songbirds as they prey on eggs and young from these birds' nests, but these same crows will cooperate with smaller birds to drive away hawks or larger mammalian predators.", "On occasion, birds will mob animals that pose no threat.", "Aposematism, where organisms are brightly colored as a warning to predators, is the antithesis of camouflage.", "Some organisms pose a threat to their predators\u2014for example they may be poisonous, or able to harm them physically.", "Aposematic coloring involves bright, easily recognizable and unique colors and patterns.", "For example, bright coloration in Variable Checkerspot butterflies leads to decreased predation attempts by avian predators.", "Upon being harmed (e.g., stung) by their prey, the appearance in such an organism will be remembered as something to avoid.", "While that particular prey organism may be killed, the coloring benefits the prey species as a whole.", "It is fairly clear that predators tend to lower the survival and fecundity of their prey, but on a higher level of organization, populations of predator and prey species also interact.", "It is obvious that predators depend on prey for survival, and this is reflected in predator populations being affected by changes in prey populations.", "It is not so obvious, however, that predators affect prey populations.", "Eating a prey organism may simply make room for another if the prey population is approaching its carrying capacity.", "A lone naked human is at a physical disadvantage to other comparable apex predators in areas such as speed, bone density, weight, and physical strength.", "Humans also lack innate weaponry such as claws.", "Without crafted weapons, society, or cleverness, a lone human can easily be defeated by fit predatory animals, such as wild dogs, big cats and bears (see Man-eater).", "However, humans are not solitary creatures; they are social animals with highly developed social behaviors.", "Early humans, such as Homo erectus, have been using stone tools and weapons for well over a million years.", "Anatomically modern humans have been apex predators since they first evolved, and many species of carnivorous megafauna actively avoid interacting with humans; the primary environmental competitor for a human is other humans.", "The one subspecies of carnivorous megafauna that does interact frequently with humans in predatory roles is the domestic dog, but usually as a partner in predation especially if they hunt together.", "Cannibalism has occurred in various places, among various cultures, and for various reasons.", "At least a few people, such as the Donner party, are said to have resorted to it in desperation.", "Having small population size is a characteristic almost universally inherent to apex predators, humans and dogs by far the most blatant exceptions.", "Low numbers wouldn't be a problem for apex predators if there was an abundance of prey and no competition or niche overlap, a scenario that is rarely, if ever, encountered in the wild.", "The competitive exclusion principle states that if two species' ecological niches overlap, there is a very high likelihood of competition as both species are in direct competition for the same resources.", "This factor alone could lead to the extirpation of one or both species, but is compounded by the added factor of prey abundance.", "A predator's effect on its prey species is hard to see in the short-term.", "However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics.", "If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find.", "This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population.", "The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources.", "If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction.", "This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators.", "This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator.", "One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible).", "An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction.", "Predators may be put to use in conservation efforts to control introduced species.", "Although the aim in this situation is to remove the introduced species entirely, keeping its abundance down is often the only possibility.", "Predators from its natural range may be introduced to control populations, though in some cases this has little effect, and may even cause unforeseen problems.", "Besides their use in conservation biology, predators are also important for controlling pests in agriculture.", "Natural predators are an environmentally friendly and sustainable way of reducing damage to crops, and are one alternative to the use of chemical agents such as pesticides."]}, {"qa": [{"answer": "253,651", "question": "What's the estimated

(also known as a friendly, a scrimmage, a demonstration, a preseason game, a warmup match, or a preparation match, depending at least in part on the sport) is a sporting event whose prize money and impact on the player's or the team's rankings is either zero or otherwise greatly reduced.", "In team sports, matches of this type are often used to help coaches and managers select players for the competitive matches of a league season or tournament.", "If the players usually play in different teams in other leagues, exhibition games offer an opportunity for the players to learn to work with each other.", "The games can be held between separate teams or between parts of the same team.", "An exhibition game may also be used to settle a challenge, to provide professional entertainment, to promote the sport, or to raise money for charities.", "Several sports leagues hold all-star games to showcase their best players against each other, while other exhibitions games may pit participants from two different leagues or countries to unofficially determine who would be the best in the world.", "International competitions like the Olympic Games may also hold exhibition games as part of a demonstration sport.", "In the early days of association football, known simply as football or soccer, friendly matches (or \"friendlies\") were the most common type of match.", "However, since the development of The Football League in England in 1888, league tournaments became established, in addition to lengthy derby and cup tournaments.", "By the year 2000, national leagues were established in almost every country throughout the world, as well as local or regional leagues for lower level teams, thus the significance of friendlies has seriously declined since the 19th century.", "Since the introduction of league football, most club sides play a number of friendlies before the start of each season (called pre-season friendlies).", "Friendly football matches are considered to be non-competitive and are only used to \"warm up\" players for a new season/competitive match.", "There is generally nothing competitive at stake and some rules may be changed or experimented with (such as unlimited substitutions, which allow teams to play younger, less experienced, players, and no cards).", "Although most friendlies are simply one-off matches arranged by the clubs themselves, in which a certain amount is paid by the challenger club to the incumbent club, some teams do compete in short tournaments, such as the Emirates Cup, Teresa Herrera Trophy and the Amsterdam Tournament.", "Although these events may involve sponsorship deals and the awarding of a trophy and may even be broadcast on television, there is little prestige attached to them.", "International teams also play friendlies, generally in preparation for the qualifying or final stages of major tournaments.", "This is essential, since national squads generally have much less time together in which to prepare.", "The biggest difference between friendlies at the club and international levels is that international friendlies mostly take place during club league seasons, not between them.", "This has on occasion led to disagreement between national associations and clubs as to the availability of players, who could become injured or fatigued in a friendly.", "International friendlies give team managers the opportunity to experiment with team selection and tactics before the tournament proper, and also allow them to assess the abilities of players they may potentially select for the tournament squad.", "Players can be booked in international friendlies, and can be suspended from future international matches based on red cards or accumulated yellows in a specified period.", "Caps and goals scored also count towards a player's career records.", "In 2004, FIFA ruled that substitutions by a team be limited to six per match in international friendlies, in response to criticism that such matches were becoming increasingly farcical with managers making as many as 11 substitutions per match.", "In the UK and Ireland, \"exhibition match\" and \"friendly match\" refer to two different types of matches.", "The types described above as friendlies are not termed exhibition matches, while annual all-star matches such as those held in the US Major League Soccer or Japan's Japanese League are called exhibition matches rather than friendly matches.", "A one-off match for charitable fundraising, usually involving one or two all-star teams, or a match held in honor of a player for contribution to his/her club, may also be described as exhibition matches but they are normally referred to as charity matches and testimonial matches respectively.", "Under the 1995\u20132004 National Hockey League collective bargaining agreement, teams were limited to nine preseason games.", "From 1975 to 1991, NHL teams sometimes played exhibition games against teams from the Soviet Union in the Super Series, and in 1978, played against World Hockey Association teams also in preseason training.", "Like the NFL, the NHL sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own NHL teams, often at a club's minor league affiliate (e.g. Carolina Hurricanes games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, home of their AHL affiliate; Los Angeles Kings games at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California, home of their ECHL affiliate; Montreal Canadiens games at Colis\u00e9e Pepsi in Quebec City, which has no pro hockey but used to have an NHL team until 1995; Washington Capitals at 1st Mariner Arena in the Baltimore Hockey Classic; various Western Canada teams at Credit Union Centre in Saskatoon, a potential NHL expansion venue).", "Since the 2000s,

Yankees played in the Mayor's Trophy Game against various local rivals from 1946 to 1983.", "It also used to be commonplace to have a team play an exhibition against Minor League affiliates during the regular season, but worries of injuries to players, along with travel issues, have made this very rare.", "Exhibitions between inter-city teams in different leagues, like Chicago's Crosstown Classic and New York's Subway Series which used to be played solely as exhibitions for bragging rights are now blended into interleague play.", "The annual MLB All-Star Game, played in July between players from AL teams and players from NL teams, was long considered an exhibition match, but as of 2003 this status was questioned because the league whose team wins the All-Star game has been awarded home field advantage for the upcoming World Series.", "National Basketball Association teams play eight preseason games per year.", "Today, NBA teams almost always play each other in the preseason, but mainly at neutral sites within their market areas in order to allow those who can't usually make a trip to a home team's arena during the regular season to see a game close to home; for instance the Minnesota Timberwolves will play games in arenas in North Dakota and South Dakota, while the Phoenix Suns schedule one exhibition game outdoors at Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells,

in each tour.", "Compared to other team sports, the National Football League preseason is very structured.", "Every NFL team plays exactly four pre-season exhibition games a year, two at home and two away, with the exception of two teams each year who play a fifth game, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game.", "These exhibition games, most of which are held in the month of August, are played for the purpose of helping coaches narrow down the roster from the offseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season limit of 53 players.", "While the scheduling formula is not as rigid for preseason games as they are for the regular season, there are numerous restrictions and traditions that limit the choices of preseason opponents; teams are also restricted on what days and times they can play these games.", "Split-squad games, a practice common in baseball and hockey, where a team that is scheduled to play two games on the same day splits their team into two squads, are prohibited.", "The NFL has played exhibition games in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia (including the American Bowl in 1999) and Mexico to spread the league's popularity (a game of this type was proposed for China but, due to financial and logistical problems, was eventually canceled).", "The league has tacitly forbidden the playing of non-league opponents, with the last interleague game having come in 1972 and the last game against a team other than an NFL team (the all-NFL rookie College All-Stars) was held in 1976.", "Exhibition games are quite unpopular with many fans, who resent having to pay regular-season prices for two home exhibition games as part of a season-ticket package.", "Numerous lawsuits have been brought by fans and classes of fans against the NFL or its member teams regarding this practice, but none have been successful in halting it.", "[citation needed] The Pro Bowl, traditionally played after the end of the NFL season (since 2011 is played the week prior to the Super Bowl), is also considered an exhibition game.", "The Arena Football League briefly had a two-game exhibition season in the early 2000s, a practice that ended in 2003 with a new television contract.", "Exhibition games outside of a structured season are relatively common among indoor American football leagues; because teams switch leagues frequently at that level of play, it is not uncommon to see some of the smaller leagues schedule exhibition games against teams that are from another league, about to join the league as a probational franchise, or a semi-pro outdoor team to fill holes in a schedule.", "True exhibition games between opposing colleges at the highest level do not exist in college football; due to the importance of opinion polling in the top level of college football, even exhibition games would not truly be exhibitions because they could influence the opinions of those polled.", "Intramural games are possible because a team playing against itself leaves little ability for poll participants to make judgments, and at levels below the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), championships are decided by objective formulas and thus those teams can play non-league games without affecting their playoff hopes.", "However, most of the major FBS teams annually schedule early season non-conference preseason home games against lesser opponents that are lower-tier FBS, Football Championship, or Division II schools, which often result in lopsided victories in favor of the FBS teams and act as exhibition games in all but name, though they additionally provide a large appearance fee and at least one guaranteed television appearance for the smaller school.", "These games also receive the same criticism as NFL exhibition games, but instead it is targeted to schools scheduling low-quality opponents and the simplicity for a team to run up the score against a weak opponent.", "However, these games are susceptible to backfiring, resulting in damage in poll position and public perception, especially if the higher ranked team loses, although the mere act of scheduling a weak opponent is harmful to a team's overall strength of schedule itself.", "Games an FBS team schedules against lower division opponents do not count toward the minimum seven wins required for bowl eligibility, and only one game against an FCS team can be counted.", "With the start of the College Football Playoff system for the 2014 season, major teams are now discouraged from scheduling weaker opponents for their non-conference schedule because of a much higher emphasis on strength of schedule than in the Bowl Championship Series era.", "High school football teams frequently participate in controlled scrimmages with other teams during preseason practice, but exhibition games are rare because of league rules and concerns about finances, travel and player injuries, along with enrollments not being registered until the early part of August in most school districts under the traditional September\u2013June academic term.", "A more common exhibition is the high school football all-star game, which brings together top players from a region.", "These games are typically played by graduating seniors during the summer or at the end of the season.", "Many of these games, which include the U.S. Army All-American Bowl and Under Armour All-America Game, are used as showcases for players to be seen by colleges.", "Various auto racing organizations hold exhibition events; these events usually award no championship points to participants, but they do offer prize money to participants.", "The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series holds two exhibition events annually - the Sprint Unlimited, held at Daytona International Speedway at the start of the season, and the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, held at Charlotte Motor Speedway midway through the season.", "Both events carry a hefty purse of over USD $1,000,000.", "NASCAR has also held exhibition races at Suzuka Circuit and Twin Ring Motegi in Japan and Calder Park Thunderdome in Australia."]}]
